Titolo: Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash is a Nintendo 3DS game co-developed by Skip Ltd. and Vanpool and published by Nintendo. It was released in Japan and North America in October 2015, and in Europe and Australia in November. It is the fifth and most recent game in the Chibi-Robo! series, and the second Chibi-Robo! game on the 3DS after Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder (2014).
Unlike previous Chibi-Robo! games, Zip Lash is a 2D sidescroller game where the player takes control of the robot Chibi-Robo, tasked with defending the world's resources from aliens. The decision to shift genres was taken in the hopes of expanding the franchise's fanbase in the west, as previous Chibi-Robo! games had sold poorly in western regions compared to Japan and Asia. 
Zip Lash was a commercial failure and received mixed reviews from critics with praise for the visuals, sound, and overall charm but criticism for its level design, controls, and gameplay mechanics, with many calling the game unoriginal and uninspired. The franchise has remained dormant since and developer Skip Ltd. has not developed any other games since the game's release.
