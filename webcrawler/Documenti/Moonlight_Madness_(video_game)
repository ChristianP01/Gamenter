Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Moonlight Madness is a video game for the ZX Spectrum home computer, published in 1986 by Bubble Bus Software. It is an arcade adventure game in which players control a boy scout. The object of the game is to unlock a safe within a mansion to obtain pills for the mansion's owner, a mad scientist, who has collapsed. This requires the player to traverse the mansion's rooms while avoiding hazards such as dangerous house servants and fatal falls.
The game was developed by John F. Cain, who had previously created Booty, a popular budget game. Moonlight Madness was criticized for its price on release, Â£7.95 in the UK, as well its technical issues. The game's graphics, gameplay and sound were negatively rated by critics, though some reviewers were more positive over these different aspects of the game.
