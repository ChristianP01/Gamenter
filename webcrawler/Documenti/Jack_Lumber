Descrizione: Jack Lumber is a video game developed by Owlchemy Labs. The iOS version was the first game published by Sega's third-party publishing program Sega Alliance.In addition to mobile stores, the game is also available on Steam. This version was released independent of Sega because, according to Owlchemy Labs founder Alex Schwartz, "[W]orking with publishers has been a big experiment, and so far it hasn’t been financially successful for Owlchemy." There are also plans to release it on other platforms that "don’t involve a publisher."
