Titolo: Spirit Hunter: NG

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Spirit Hunter: NG, short for No Good, is a 2018 visual novel adventure video game developed by Experience. It is the second entry in their Spirit Hunter series, following 2017's Spirit Hunter: Death Mark, and is planned to be followed by the in-development Shinigami: Shibito Magire. The game was originally released for the PlayStation Vita, and has since been ported to the PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo Switch.
In the game, the player investigates haunted locations, searching for clues relating to spirits, aiming to purify or destroy the spirit. The investigations are carried out together with partner characters, who the protagonist can form bonds with. The game was directed by Motoya Ataka, produced by Hajime Chikami, and designed by Yuuki Miura and Tomohiro Kokubu, and was developed to contrast with the previous game in the series in terms of its writing and protagonist, with gradually introduced horror and a hot-blooded player character. Critics praised the game for its story, characterization, and visuals, and considered it a good game for fans of Asian horror.
