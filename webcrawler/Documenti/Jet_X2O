Titolo: Jet X2O

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Jet X2O is a watercraft racing and stunt performance game that was developed by Killer Game and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.
The game involves the player racing a jetski on various courses while maneuvering the vehicle around various obstacles. Unlike similar games like those in the Wave Race series, however, Jet X2O also places emphasis on performing tricks (which is a hallmark of many winter sports video games, including the SSX series).
Despite the game's title, the game is not considered a spin-off of the Jet Moto series.
