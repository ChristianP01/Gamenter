Titolo: My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (video game)

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic is a video game that was based on the animated television series of the same name, which was developed by Gameloft for most iOS and Android devices and is recommended at children aged 5 to 12. The game was officially released on November 8, 2012.
In the game, the player gets asked by Twilight Sparkle to help her rebuild her hometown of Ponyville after it had fallen into the shadow of Princess Luna and the villainous Nightmare Moon. To do so, the player uses in-game currency and other collected treasures to build homes to bring more ponies to the town, and then they will create businesses for them to work at and to generate money. Mini-games can be used to build the skill level of each pony, qualifying them to work at jobs that can help generate more revenue. Though primarily played as a single-player game, players can visit their friends' versions of Ponyville, and also leave and accept gifts to help their own village. This game is guided by a quest and experience system. While Gameloft had developed the game towards the show's target audience of young girls, they also include nods to the adult fandom of the show.
Despite being generally well-received, the game was criticized as exemplifying the underlying nature of freemium games where either the player must spend real money, feed their pony or wait for a very long period of time in order to join the game.
