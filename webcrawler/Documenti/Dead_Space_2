Set three years after the events of the first game, the game follows protagonist Isaac Clarke's fight against a new Necromorph outbreak on the Sprawl, a space station surrounding a shard of Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

A Collector's Edition is available for all three platforms; the PlayStation 3 Limited Edition includes Dead Space: Extraction as a PlayStation Move compatible title. A port for Wii was planned, but not released. It is one of the most expensive video games, made with a $120 million budget split evenly between development and marketing during 2008 to 2010.Dead Space 2 received critical acclaim. A sequel, Dead Space 3, was released in February 2013 to positive reviews, but to sales numbers that EA considered to be insufficient.
