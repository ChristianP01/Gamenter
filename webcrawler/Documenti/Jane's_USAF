Descrizione: Jane's USAF is a combat flight simulation video game developed by Israeli studio Pixel Multimedia and released in 1999 as part of Jane's Combat Simulations series. The game is set from the late 1960s to the early 2000s and it is a jet aircraft survey simulation featuring satellite imagery for terrain which allowed quite detailed graphics for the time of the release of Jane's USAF. The game features four campaigns: the Vietnam War, Persian Gulf War, and two fictional campaigns, one based on the Red Flag exercises and one depicting a war between NATO and Russia in the then-future of 2005.  Also included are single missions, with maps from the Middle East to Korea.  Training missions include take-off, landing, and refuelling in Nellis Air Force Base.
