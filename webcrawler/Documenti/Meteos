Titolo: Meteos

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Meteos (Japanese: メテオス, Hepburn: Meteosu) is a 2005 tile-matching video game developed by Q Entertainment and published by Bandai (Nintendo outside Japan) for the Nintendo DS. It was produced by Q Entertainment founder Tetsuya Mizuguchi and designed by Masahiro Sakurai.  Meteos was inspired by the video game Missile Command (1980), the film The Matrix (1999) and the television series 24 (2001-2010).
Gameplay requires the use of a stylus to move colored blocks called "meteos", which fall from the top of the screen. The game ends when the blocks fill up the screen; to prevent this from happening, the player must launch three or more blocks of the same color onto the top of the screen to make them disappear. Playable characters include thirty-two aliens and their respective planets.
Meteos received critical acclaim and reached number one in DS sales in the UK market during its first week, according to research company Chart-Track. It was compared to other puzzle games, such as Tetris (1984) and Lumines (2004). The game received awards and nominations from several publications, including the CESA Game Awards' Outstanding Performance Award. Versions were released for mobile phones and the Xbox Live Arcade in 2006 and 2008, respectively. A sequel, Meteos: Disney Magic, was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007.
