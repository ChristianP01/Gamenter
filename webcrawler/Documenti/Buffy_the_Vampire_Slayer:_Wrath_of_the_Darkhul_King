Descrizione: Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Wrath of the Darkhul King is a 2003 platform game developed by Natsume and published by THQ. Based on the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the game features Buffy Summers who fights vampires, demons, and other supernatural entities as the Slayer. The player controls Buffy through 16 side-scrolling levels that focus on solving puzzles and defeating enemies by using customizable weapons. Set in the show's fourth season, the story is about Buffy attempting to prevent a demonic warlord from returning to Earth.
THQ produced Wrath of the Darkhul King in a publishing agreement with Fox Interactive, and chose Natsume as the developers because they had been working together since 1999. Influenced by their family-friendly image, Natsume presented Buffy as an inspirational character to their young audience. The developer struggled with adapting Buffy the Vampire Slayer into 2D computer graphics, citing issues with character sprites.
Wrath of the Darkhul King was released for the Game Boy Advance on June 24, 2003. It was the third of six Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games. Critical reception of the game was poor; reviewers disliked the gameplay and lack of connection to the television series, but had a mixed response to the graphics and audio.
