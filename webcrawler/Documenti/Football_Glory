Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Football Glory is a 1994 football video game developed by Croteam and published by Black Legend. One or two players compete in football matches viewed from a top-down perspective and modelled after one of six leagues and cups. The players can perform various moves, including tackles and bicycle kicks, and view instant replays of highlights. The pitch is occasionally invaded by dogs, streakers, hooligans, and police.
Football Glory was Croteam's debut game, with the development commencing in April 1993. The core team of six people worked from Zagreb with London-based Richard M. Holmes of Black Legend after the publisher signed with Croteam in 1994. The team took inspiration from past World Cup matches, primarily those of the Brazil national football team. Football Glory was released for the Amiga in November 1994 as the first commercial game developed by a Croatian studio. It was followed by a port for MS-DOS in May 1995 and a budget Amiga release later that year.
Football Glory was frequently compared to Sensible Soccer and noted for its expanded move set. The game's audio and visuals were well received, while interruptions by lengthy animations and some technical issues were criticised. Sensible Soccer developer Sensible Software considered Football Glory a clone and threatened Croteam with legal action, causing Football Glory to be temporarily taken off sale. Croteam released the game as freeware in 1998. The studio finished a five-a-side football successor (known by various names, including Five-A-Side Soccer and Football Glory Indoors) in 1995, which was released by Black Legend's German branch in 1996 and by Croteam as public-domain software in March 2000.
