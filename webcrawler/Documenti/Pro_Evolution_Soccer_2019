It is the 18th installment in the PES series and was released on 28 August 2018 in North America and on 30 August 2018 in Japan, Europe and Australia. FC Barcelona winger Philippe Coutinho appears on the front cover of the standard edition, whereas David Beckham appears on the front cover of the legend edition. Scottish clubs Celtic and Rangers have been brought to the game along with their stadiums, bringing the world-famous Old Firm derby to the gaming world in detail. This was the final installment in the franchise to be branded as just PES, following the decision to rebrand it eFootball Pro Evolution Soccer, starting with 2020's edition and then just simply eFootball for the upcoming installment.
For this year's edition, Konami had promised to increase the number of licenses, which included more fully licensed leagues and stadiums and a variety of new legends to play with. Until then, the official championships announced directly by Konami were 12 leagues which include the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, Danish Superligaen, the Portuguese Primeira Liga, the Belgian Jupiler Pro League, the Swiss Raiffeisen Super League, the Scottish Premiership, the Dutch Eredivisie, the Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n. However, Konami announced that it did not renew its deal with UEFA for the Champions League, Europa League, and the UEFA Super Cup which they had for 10 years; the licence is being used in EA Sports FIFA 19. PES 2019 was succeeded by eFootball Pro Evolution Soccer 2020.
