Descrizione: Kabu Trader Shun (Japanese: 株トレーダー瞬, Hepburn: Kabu Toreda Shun, literally "Stock Trader Shun") is an adventure video game for the Nintendo DS. The game was developed by Inti Creates, published by Capcom, and released exclusively in Japan on June 7, 2007. The plot follows the young protagonist Shun Aiba entering the lucrative world of stock trading in order to follow in the footsteps of his father, a famous trader himself who disappeared five years earlier. The goal of the game is increase Shun's wealth with gameplay consisting of daily management of personal stocks, traveling around various points of interest within a city to advance the story, and engaging in one-on-one battles with rival stock traders.
Director Yukio Ando used his personal experience in the stock market for its development. The trading simulation gameplay was simplified and combined with adventure game components, while manga and anime elements were incorporated into its graphics and plot, all in an attempt to broaden the game's appeal. Kabu Trader Shun was one of several DS games based around stock trading that was available on the DS in Japan at that time. Prior to its release, news outlets universally compared the game's overall presentation to Capcom's visual novel legal drama series Ace Attorney. Kabu Trader Shun sold poorly and was never released outside of Japan.
