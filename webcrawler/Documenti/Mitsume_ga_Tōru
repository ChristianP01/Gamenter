Descrizione: Mitsume ga Tōru (三つ目がとおる, "The Three-Eyed One") is a Japanese action/adventure manga series written and illustrated by legendary Japanese mangaka Osamu Tezuka. It was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Magazine from 7 July 1974 through 19 March 1978 and was later published into thirteen tankōbon volumes by Kodansha.In 1977, Mitsume ga Tōru tied with another Tezuka manga, Black Jack, for the Kodansha Manga Award. The manga has since spawned an animated television film, Akumatō no Purinsu: Mitsume ga Tōru (悪魔島のプリンス 三つ目がとおる, "The Prince of Devil Island: The Three-Eyed One"), produced by Toei Animation for Nippon TV that aired on 25 August 1985, and five years later, an anime television series produced by Tezuka Productions, which ran on TV Tokyo for a total of 48 episodes from 18 October 1990 until 26 September 1991. The latter series adaptation was planned in the wake of the first anniversary of Tezuka's death on 9 February 1989.The main character, Hosuke Sharaku, had had appearances outside the manga as a recurring character in Tezuka's Star System, appearing in two television films, One Million-Year Trip: Bander Book (1978) and Undersea Super Train: Marine Express (1979) respectively, and one episode of the series Blue Blink ("A Prisoner at Rose House", 1989). Sharaku also appeared in three video games: Mitsume ga Tōru: The Three-Eyed One Comes Here by Natsume on the MSX in 1989, Mitsume ga Tōru by Tomy on the NES in 1992, Astro Boy: Omega Factor by Sega on the Game Boy Advance (as Astro Boy's arch-enemy) and Astro Boy by Sega on the PlayStation 2 (as an ally to Astro Boy in a sidequest).
