Descrizione: Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp is a role-playing video game with board game elements, developed and published by Spike Chunsoft for the Nintendo Switch in late 2021. The game, a spin-off installment in the Danganronpa visual novel series, is an expanded version of two side-modes from Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony (2017), and was released digitally as a standalone game and physically through the game compilation Danganronpa Decadence, as a part of celebrations for the 10th anniversary of the Danganronpa series.
The game is set on the tropical resort known as Jabberwock Island, and follows a group of 62 students and related persons as they search for hope over the course of a 50-day-long summer test program. The game, directed by Shun Sasaki, was released in November 2021 in Japan and a month later in the west. Upon launch, Ultimate Summer Camp was met with mixed reception from critics, who mainly criticized the gameplay loop and inclusion of microtransactions, while appreciating how the game could potentially be enjoyed by Danganronpa fans for its character interactions and fan service.
