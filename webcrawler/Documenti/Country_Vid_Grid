Titolo: Country Vid Grid

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Country Vid Grid is a tile-matching full motion video puzzle game developed by Geffen Records and published by Jasmine Multimedia Publishing for Windows on May 1995. It is a spin-off of the original Vid Grid, which was released in June 1994, and is the third and last entry in the franchise of the same name.
Similarly with the previous two titles, the main objective of the players is to resolve and finish a jigsaw puzzle on time before the music video that is being played on the background ends. Produced by series creator Norman Beil and conceived as a joint-venture between MCA Nashville and Jasmine Multimedia, Country Vid Grid puts emphasis on country music as its main theme unlike the original Vid Grid and Kid Vid Grid, which were themed after rock music and cartoons respectively.
