Titolo: Phase Zero

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Phase Zero  is an unreleased action-shooter video game that was in development by Hyper Image Productions and originally planned to be published by Atari Corporation on a scheduled September 1995 release date exclusively for the Atari Jaguar. It was the only game in development by Hyper Image.
Assuming the role of a newcomer pilot from the titular squadron assigned to fight against an rival organization only known as The Collective in a foreign planet, players take control of a windowless VTV hovertank craft called Hunter in order to complete a series of missions and tasks, while battling against enemy VTV hovertanks. Hyper Image  was originally working on a top-down shooter for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, before the team later moved to the Jaguar with Phase Zero and opted to use their own interpretation of the heightmap technique to render the landscapes and visuals, in addition of also placing emphasis on LAN play for multiplayer.Though the team at Hyper Image kept working on Phase Zero, despite not receiving anymore payment for its development in mid-1995, Atari Corp. ultimately halted and terminated the project in March 1996 along with other upcoming titles for the platform, a month before Atari merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover on April of the same year. Although unreleased, a playable prototype has since been released and sold online by independent groups such as B&C Computervisions and later Songbird Productions.
