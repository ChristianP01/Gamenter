Titolo: Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising (abbreviated as G&H or GnH) was a massively multiplayer online role-playing video game developed by Heatwave Interactive and released in 2011 for Microsoft Windows. The game was set in Ancient Rome, and combined historical elements and enemies (Etruscans, Faliscans, etc.) with mythological ones (Cyclopes, Gorgons, etc.). Players selected era-appropriate classes (Soldiers, Gladiators, Mystics, and Priests), each of which could be aligned with an Olympian god (such as Jupiter or Mars).
Originally developed by Perpetual Entertainment, the game was put on indefinite hold in October 2007. In February 2010, Heatwave Interactive announced it had acquired the rights to the game and planned to continue its development. The game was released in June 2011 with a retail purchase and subscription. In early 2012 the game switched to a free-to-play model with a $10 purchase of the game. The game and its forums entered maintenance in September 2012 and never fully returned, although some existing players were still able to log into game servers afterwards. Steam has since removed the game from its shop.
