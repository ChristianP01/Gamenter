Descrizione: Psychic Force 2012 (サイキックフォース2012, Saikikku Fōsu 2012) is a 1998 arcade fighting game developed by Taito as the sequel to their 1995 title, Psychic Force. The game was first released in arcades in 1998 and was then ported a year later to the Dreamcast, becoming one of the console's earliest titles when it was released in Japan on March 4, 1999. A North American version was released on November 9, 1999 and a year later in Europe, distributed by Acclaim Entertainment but self-published by Taito.
The game was also adapted for the PlayStation and released under the title of Psychic Force 2 (サイキックフォース2, Saikikku Fōsu Tsū) in Japan on October 7, 1999 and the PAL Regions in 2001. This version features downgraded graphics, but includes several extra modes (such as the "Psy-Expand" mode), an animated FMV intro, and three returning characters from the original Psychic Force (Sonia, Brad and Genma) who had been omitted in Psychic Force 2012. In 2006, Psychic Force 2012 was re-released as part of an anniversary pack for the PlayStation 2 titled Psychic Force Complete, which also includes the original Psychic Force and a special exclusive remixed version of 2012 titled Psychic Force 2012 EX.
Location test for the Taito NESiCAxLive version occurred between November 2 and November 6 of 2012.
