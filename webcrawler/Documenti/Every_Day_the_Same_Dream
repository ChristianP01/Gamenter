Descrizione: Every Day the Same Dream (stylised in title case) is a short, 2D art game that puts the player in the role of a man whose life is about to change. Developed for the Experimental Gameplay Project at Carnegie Mellon University in 2009, the game has been described as "a beautiful game with a very bleak outlook." Italian creator Paolo Pedercini claims it is "a short existential game about alienation and refusal of labor." It has been compared to Passage by Jason Rohrer and Don't Look Back by Terry Cavanagh in that it is "an interesting, potentially fascinating experience."
