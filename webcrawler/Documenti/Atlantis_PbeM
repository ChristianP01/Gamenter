Descrizione: Atlantis is a free open-ended multi-player computer moderated fantasy turn-based strategy game for any number of players. It is played via email. The game world is populated by many races and monsters. Players may attempt to carve out huge empires, become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich traders or any other career that comes to mind and interact with other players in trade, war and alliances. There is no declared winner of the game, players set their own objectives, and one can join at any time.
Russell Wallace developed the initial version and ran the first game, Atlantis 1.0 in 1993. Geoff Dunbar continued the legacy, first with the extensive playtest of Atlantis 2.0, and then the commercial game Atlantis 3.0. Atlantis 4.0 was created by Geoff Dunbar. AtlantisDev was formed sometime after that and Joseph Traub became the maintainer of the code. Atlantis 4.0 was later expanded on by various contributors from the AtlantisDev group. The current version is 5.1.
