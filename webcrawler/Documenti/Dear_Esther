Descrizione: Dear Esther is a first-person exploration and adventure video game developed by The Chinese Room for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. First released in 2008 as a free-to-play modification for the Source game engine, the game was entirely redeveloped for a commercial release in 2012. Featuring minimalistic gameplay, the player's only objective in the game is to explore an unnamed island in the Hebrides, Scotland, listening to a troubled man read a series of letters to his deceased wife. Details of her mysterious death are revealed as the player moves throughout the island.
The Chinese Room released a spiritual successor to Dear Esther, titled Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, in 2015.
In 2017 an updated version, Dear Esther: Landmark Edition was released, based on the Unity engine.
