Titolo: Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds (1999 video game)

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds is a vehicular combat third-person shooter  video game. It was based primarily on the 1978 concept album Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds, but also draws from the original 1898 War of the Worlds novel by H. G. Wells. The game was developed by Pixelogic and released in Europe exclusively for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. The game was never released in North America.
The game's visuals are based heavily on the album's artwork, which was created by Mike Trim, Geoff Taylor and Peter Goodfellow.Though it reuses audio and graphical elements of Rage Software's PC game of the same title, and is set during the same time period, it is not a port, remake or re-release of that game, but an entirely different adaptation of the same source material.
