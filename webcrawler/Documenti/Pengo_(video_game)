Titolo: Pengo (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Pengo (ペンゴ) is an arcade game developed by Coreland and published by Sega in 1982. The player controls Pengo, a red penguin that resides in the Antarctic. The game takes place in an overhead maze made of ice blocks, where Pengo crushes blob-like Sno-Bees by sliding blocks into them. The objective is to survive each round by eliminating all Sno-Bees and Sno-Bee eggs, while optionally lining up the three diamond blocks for a large bonus.
There are two versions of the arcade game: the first uses "Popcorn" as the theme, and the second has original music. There are other small differences as well. Pengo was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, and Sega Game Gear.
