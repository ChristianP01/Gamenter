Titolo: Mystic Wand

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Mystic Wand (Japanese: ミスティックワンド, Hepburn: Misutikku Wando) is an unreleased 1991 puzzle-platform game that was in development and planned to be published by Alpha Denshi for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms.
Taking place in a fantasy world, players assume the role of two magicians as they travel to multiple locations fighting against demonic enemies and ultimately scale to the top of a tower in order to face Satan, who must be vanquished for good. Mystic Wand was previewed across a few video game magazines and trade shows to the public for testing, however, it was ultimately shelved for unknown reasons.
