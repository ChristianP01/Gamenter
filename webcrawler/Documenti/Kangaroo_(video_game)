Titolo: Kangaroo (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Kangaroo (Japanese: カンガルー) is a four-screen platform game released in arcades in 1982 by Sun Electronics and distributed in North America by Atari, Inc. Kangaroo is one of the first arcade games similar in style to Donkey Kong without being a direct clone. The player takes the role of a boxing glove-wearing mother kangaroo who is trying to rescue her child from fruit-throwing monkeys.
Despite featuring jumping, there is no jump button. Instead, the player pushes up on the joystick—or up and diagonally—to jump.
