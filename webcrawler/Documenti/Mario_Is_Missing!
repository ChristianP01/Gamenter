Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Mario Is Missing! is a 1993 educational game developed and published by The Software Toolworks for MS-DOS, Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A Macintosh version was released in 1994. The player controls Luigi, who must travel around the world to find and return stolen treasures as part of a quest to find his brother, Mario, who has been captured by Bowser. Mario Is Missing!, part of a series of educational Mario games, marked Luigi's first starring role in a video game (although he was the main character of the 1990 Game Watch game Luigi's Hammer Toss), which would not occur again until 2001, when Luigi's Mansion was released for the GameCube.
