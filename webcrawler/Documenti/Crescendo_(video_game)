Titolo: Crescendo (video game)

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Crescendo: Eien Dato Omotte Ita Ano Koro (Crescendo ～永遠だと思っていたあの頃～) is an adult Japanese visual novel written by Tomohiro Minakami and developed by Digital Object. It was released in Japan for Windows on September 28, 2001. A 'Full Voice Version' of the game was released in Japan on July 25, 2003, including full voice acting (apart from the protagonist) and extended scenarios for each character. The voice assets from this version of the game, but not the extended scenarios, were utilized by G-Collections in their English translation of the game, which was released on October 20, 2003. A reprint version was released in Japan on March 4, 2005 and a Russian version was produced by Macho Studio in 2007.
The game follows a student named Ryo Sasaki through the five days leading up to his high school graduation. The story is presented as text, laid over graphics of the player's current location and other characters who are present. The player progresses through the story and is occasionally presented with decisions that determine the path the game will take.
Crescendo is told from a third person perspective. This allows the game to shift to other characters' viewpoints from time to time. Most of the game is played from Ryo's point of view, though. Crescendo is a unique visual novel in that none of the background music used within the game were composed by Yoshio Tsuru for the purpose of the game; instead, it uses various famous songs, pieces, and folk songs (and rearrangements thereof) as its background music, tying the motif of music more closely into the game. This game also includes an in-universe nod to characters from an earlier Digital Object game Kana: Little Sister, where the player can watch a movie based on the lives of the characters from that game.
