Descrizione: StarCraft II: Nova Covert Ops is a downloadable content (DLC) single-player mission pack for the military science fiction real-time strategy game series StarCraft II. Consisting of nine missions, it was released over the course of three installments as DLC, with three missions in each separably purchasable pack. The first mission pack was released March 29, 2016, the second mission pack released on August 2, 2016 and the final mission pack was released on November 22, 2016.The plot focuses on the aftermath of StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void, set sometime after its conclusion in 2508. The protagonist is the psionic operative Nova, a character announced in 2002 as the lead character of the game StarCraft: Ghost, which was cancelled during development.
Gaming media commented that the mission packs were a proxy for the cancelled StarCraft: Ghost, though Blizzard said that its story was not a large factor of Nova Covert Ops's storyline. The mission pack is centered around Nova, offering several strategies and customisation such as stealth and mobility, similar to what the intention of StarCraft: Ghost was.
