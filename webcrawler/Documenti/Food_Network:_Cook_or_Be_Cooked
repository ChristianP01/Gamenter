Titolo: Food Network: Cook or Be Cooked

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Food Network: Cook or Be Cooked is a cooking simulation-styled minigame compilation developed by American studio Red Fly Studio and published by Namco Bandai Games. It was released exclusively in North America on November 3, 2009, and is the first video game to use the Food Network license. The Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 ports were supposed to be released, but they were cancelled for unknown reasons.
Cook or Be Cooked contains twelve different meals to prepare; the player must go through recipes and complete the meals by completing minigames correctly. The game features a single player mode, a hotseat mode allowing up to four players to prepare one meal, and a multiplayer cook-off mode between two people. Cook or Be Cooked garnered mediocre reviews from critics upon release, who noted a lack of content in the game.
