Titolo: The Continuum

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: The Continuum was an online strategy game that combines turn-based war gaming with role-playing game-like character development and the collectability of a tabletop miniatures game. It takes place in the Crossworld, a new reality formed from the collapse of several formerly separate worlds that became unhinged in the space/time continuum. The game was developed by Seven Lights and launched on June 25, 2008. It has been discontinued as of 2011.
