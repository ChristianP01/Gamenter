Titolo: The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor is the sixth expansion for The Lord of the Rings Online MMORPG, released on July 31, 2017. It raised the game's level cap from 105 to 115 and added a new Plateau of Gorgoroth region in Mordor, which the Free People of Middle-Earth begin to explore following the downfall of Sauron, as well as a new cluster of end-game Instances and a Raid.
The release of Mordor expansion coincided with the Ninth and final Book of Volume IV: The Strength of Sauron which depicted the destruction of The One Ring and the following celebration at the Field of Cormallen in Ithilien. To signify the importance of concluding the main story of The Lord of the Rings, the next Epic Story is not called a "Volume" but rather simply "The Black Book of Mordor". Unlike the preceding Epic Quests which were available to free-to-play players or those subscribers who did not purchase previous expansion, the access to the "Black Book of Mordor" requires the purchase of either "Mordor" or the subsequent Minas Morgul expansion.
