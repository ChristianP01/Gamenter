Titolo: Gubble

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Gubble is a Microsoft Windows and PlayStation game developed by Actual Entertainment (Eric Ginner, Mark Robichek and Franz Lanzinger). The non-violent gameplay was a key aspect mentioned in the game's promotional material. The game has a soundtrack of instrumental songs composed by Seppo Hurme (who also goes by Fleshbrain).Most of the gameplay requires the player to solve a series of real-time puzzles in which they use tools, such as a hammer or screwdriver, which the main character, Gubble (an alien), uses in a humorous way to remove the implements of these tools, such as nails and screws, from the playing area.
The opening storyline to Gubble (only found in the instruction booklet) is very vague and is only used to make the game seem slightly more rational. The majority of the game is spent on the fictional planet Renigar, and many of the puzzles repeat themes of a certain world (the game is split into multiple worlds).
Gubble was later rereleased for iOS.
