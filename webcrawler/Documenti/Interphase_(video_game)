Titolo: Interphase (video game)

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Interphase is a 1989 combination first-person shooter and puzzle video game developed by The Assembly Line and published by Image Works for multiple platforms.
The developers were licensed to use concepts from Neuromancer, reflected in the virtual-reality cyberspace concept and theme of a powerful corporation.
The game is a first-person shooter, but the game primarily focuses on puzzle-solving using the interaction between a 3D cyberpunk environment and its conceptual relationship with a 2D zoomable blueprint in which a non-player character is indirectly guided through the floors of a high-security building.
Later games that have a similar style to the 3D elements in Interphase include Pyrotechnica and Rez.
