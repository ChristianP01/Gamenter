Titolo: Pitfall II: Lost Caverns

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Pitfall II: Lost Caverns is a platform video game originally released for the Atari 2600 by Activision in 1984. It is the sequel to Pitfall! (1982). Both games were designed and programmed by David Crane and star jungle explorer Pitfall Harry. Pitfall II's major additions are a much larger world with vertical scrolling, swimmable rivers with deadly eels, music, and balloons for floating between locations.
Published after the video game crash of 1983 when interest in the 2600 was waning, Pitfall II was one of the last major releases for the console and one of the most technically impressive. The cartridge contains a custom "Display Processor Chip," designed by Crane, for improved visuals and four channel music instead of the two the system is normally capable of.Pitfall II was ported to the Atari 5200, ColecoVision, TRS-80 Color Computer, Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, MSX, Commodore 64, and the IBM PCjr (as a cartridge). In 1985, Sega released an arcade remake of Pitfall II with a new visual style and gameplay that combines elements from both Pitfall I and II. It was ported to the SG-1000 console in Japan. The game's plot was loosely remade into Super Pitfall for the Famicom/NES.
