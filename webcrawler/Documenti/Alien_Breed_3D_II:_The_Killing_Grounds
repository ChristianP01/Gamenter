Titolo: Alien Breed 3D II: The Killing Grounds

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Alien Breed 3D II: The Killing Grounds is a first-person shooter, the fifth game in the Alien Breed franchise, a series of science fiction-themed shooters by Team17. It was published in 1996 by Ocean Software.
Team17 had originally intended this to be its final Amiga title. Following the success of Worms, Team17's first multi-format release, the company was looking to get out of the Amiga game market, which had become stagnant over the years. As it transpired, The Killing Grounds was not Team17's final Amiga titleâ€”Worms: The Director's Cut was released the following year.
Team17 made the game's source code freely available in March 1997, on the cover CD of Amiga Format magazine issue 95.
