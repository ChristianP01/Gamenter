Descrizione: Infamous First Light is an action-adventure video game developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 4. The game was announced at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo and was released digitally in August 2014, with a physical release of the game only being released in Europe, Asia and Australia in September 2014. The game is a standalone companion to Infamous Second Son that serves as a prequel. 
Played in a third-person perspective,  the player takes control of Abigail "Fetch" Walker (introduced as a supporting character in Infamous Second Son), a young woman classed by the Department of Unified Protection as a "conduit" who possesses superhuman powers. In custody of the D.U.P., Fetch is ordered to tell the story of the events leading up to her capture. The player can use their Neon powers to defeat enemies and traverse the environment while completing the game's levels. The game primarily takes place in the streets of a fictionalized version of Seattle and in and around the prison, Curdun Cay.
Infamous First Light received mostly positive reviews from critics, praising the protagonist Fetch, with some thinking she was a better character compared to Second Son's protagonist, Delsin, the visuals, controls, fast gameplay, and challenge arenas. Criticism was aimed towards the game's simple story and easy combat.
