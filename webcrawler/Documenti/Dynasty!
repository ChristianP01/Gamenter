Descrizione: Samurai is the 45th official video game for the Philips Videopac. in North America, the same game as released as Dynasty! for the Magnavox OdysseyÂ² console.

The game is identical to the game Reversi. It also contains two-player mode, gameplay against the computer, as well as a digital timing handicap which allows newcomers to have a better chance in beating grandmaster players in the game. Similar to other Videopac games, the game did not compare favorably to those for Atari's consoles.
