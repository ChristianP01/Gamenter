Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Islamic Fun (also known as Islamic Fun!) is a 1999 religious and educational video game, consisting of six minigames targeted at children of Muslim parents. The game was developed by the United Kingdom-based firm Innovative Minds. The game is notable for the controversy generated by "The Resistance" minigame, which allowed players to throw rocks at Israeli tanks upon correctly answering trivia. The game's message was supported by Innovative Minds' "Boycott Israel" page and campaign, which aims to raise awareness about the treatment of Palestinians in Israel.
