Titolo: SpellForce 3: Soul Harvest

Anno: 2019

Descrizione: SpellForce 3: Soul Harvest is a 2019 stand-alone expansion pack for SpellForce 3 developed by Grimlore Games and published by THQ Nordic. It was released for Microsoft Windows on 28 May 2019. While it uses the same game engine and assets as SpellForce 3, Soul Harvest does not require the player to have purchased or installed the main game to play it.
Soul Harvest adds two new races to the game, dwarves and dark elves, both with a complete set of buildings and units, that replace the elves and orcs featured in the main game. Additionally, the expansion features a completely new campaign centered around a new player character, who is joined by a mix of old and new supporting characters with different backstories and abilities. As in the main game, characters can equip various items such as armor, weapons and jewelry that influence the character's abilities and traits. When playing the campaign with another player, the secondary player can now create their own character.
The expansion was more favorably received than the main game, with many reviewers noting the improvements over the main game as well as the attention to detail and the enjoyable story.
Despite itself being an expansion, Soul Harvest received a free Oktoberfest-themed DLC in September 2019.
