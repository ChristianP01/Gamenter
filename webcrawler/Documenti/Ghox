Titolo: Ghox

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Ghox is an action arcade video game developed by Toaplan and published by Taito in Japan and Europe on November 1991. It is notable for being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles as of date. Taking place in a fantasy world where the evil magician known as Jagula sealed the goddess Lucia in the netherworld, players assume the role of Axis and Bilious in an effort to defeat both Jagula and the unleashed evil spirits from the netherworld. As of 2019, the rights to the game are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other IPs from the defunct studio.
