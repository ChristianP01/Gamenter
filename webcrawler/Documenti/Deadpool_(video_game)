Titolo: Deadpool (video game)

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Deadpool is an action-adventure video game based on the Marvel Comics antihero of the same name. The game was developed by High Moon Studios and published by Activision. It was released for the Microsoft Windows (in digital format only), PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in June 2013. Written by Daniel Way, the plot follows Deadpool (voiced by Nolan North) as he joins forces with the X-Men and Cable to thwart Mister Sinister's latest scheme, getting into numerous comedic adventures along the way. Similarly to other stories based on the character, the game features self-referential humor and fourth wall breaks.
The game received mixed reviews, being praised for its humor and plot elements while being critiqued for deficiencies in its gameplay. Deadpool, along with most other games published by Activision that had used the Marvel license, was de-listed and removed from all digital storefronts in 2014. As of July 15, 2016, the game was made available to purchase again on Steam as well as PlayStation Store's downloadable content but only in the US markets. The game was re-released on November 18, 2015 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to coincide with the release of the 2016 film based on the character. On November 16, 2017, the game was once again removed from digital storefronts due to licensing issues.
