Descrizione: Submarine Commander is a 1982 simulation video game for the Atari 8-bit family  written by Dean Lock and published by Thorn EMI Computer Software. A VIC-20 port by Gary York was released in 1983, and an Apple II version by Patrick Buckland the same year. The Atari version was re-released in 1985 on cassette on the Sparklers budget label.  A version for the TI-99/4 was announced but was not released until 1986 when a third party bought the rights.
Submarine Commander simulates the operations of a German U-boat during World War II. The action takes place in the Mediterranean Sea, where the player has to track down a number of allied convoys and then approach them underwater to attack with their torpedoes. Submarine Commander plays in real time: the actions of the player and those of the enemy convoys occur simultaneously.
