Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a 1988 graphic adventure game by Lucasfilm Games. It was the second game to use the SCUMM engine, after Maniac Mansion. The project was led by David Fox, with Matthew Alan Kane as the co-designer and co-programmer.
Like Maniac Mansion, it was developed for the Commodore 64 and later released in 1988 for that system and MS-DOS. An Apple II version was apparently planned, but never released. The following year in 1989, the game was ported to the Amiga and Atari ST.
