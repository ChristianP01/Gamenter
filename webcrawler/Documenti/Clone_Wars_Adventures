Titolo: Clone Wars Adventures

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Clone Wars Adventures was an online virtual world based on the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Players could create and customize in-world avatars and participate in a variety of Clone Wars-themed mini-games and activities, earning Republic credits to purchase new weapons, outfits, ships, and furniture. Clone Wars Adventures was free to download and play, but only those that had a paid membership got access to a majority of the game's features. Additionally, many outfits and premium items could only be purchased with Station Cash, a form of in game currency that players needed to purchase with real money instead of in-game credits. This MMO game follows a similar business model to Free Realms. However, unlike Free Realms, the game was released at retail, though the game is free-to-play.Clone Wars Adventures reached one of its milestones after 10 million players registered for the game. The first ten million players who joined were given a free Golden Death Watch set and a huge presentation of game statistics from SOE since the game's launch. On January 24, 2014, Sony Online Entertainment announced that the game would be shut down on March 31, 2014.
