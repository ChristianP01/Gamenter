Titolo: Warhead (video game)

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Warhead is a 3D space combat simulator for Amiga (A500 and A2000) and Atari ST platforms. It was created by British developer Glyn Williams in 1989.
The game takes place during a war between the alien forces of Sirius and the humans of Earth. The player fights for the Earth forces. The game is played as sequential missions. Completing a mission successfully lets the player advance to the next mission. It is possible to save the game status after each mission, but not during a mission. Typical mission objectives include intelligence gathering, search and rescue missions, destroying enemies and protecting friendly forces. The player is sent for missions from the SolBase, a military base orbiting the Sun. The player must travel to different solar systems using a device that allows faster than light travel through quad-space, which is a form of hyperspace.
Warhead spawned a spiritual sequel, XF5700 Mantis in 1992.
