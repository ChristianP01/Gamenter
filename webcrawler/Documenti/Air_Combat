Titolo: Air Combat

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Air Combat is a 1995 combat flight simulation video game developed and published for the PlayStation by Namco. The plot involves a mercenary air force being assembled to stop a terrorist organization from seizing control of the government in the fictional country of Usea. Players control an aircraft and are tasked with completing a series of missions, with objectives ranging from destroying formations of enemies to protecting a specific target from enemy fire. Missions award money that is used to purchase new aircraft, each with its own unique weapons and strengths.
Air Combat is based on a 1993 arcade game of the same name that ran on the Namco System 21 hardware. Company employees Masanori Kato and Kazumi Mizuno were tasked with bringing the game to the then-new PlayStation, but decided to create a new game from scratch after realizing the PlayStation's hardware was not powerful enough to properly render the arcade version's gameplay. Air Combat shipped 2.23 million copies worldwide and was later reprinted under Sony's The Best budget title range. Critics found enjoyment in the game's arcade-like gameplay, realism, and cinematic approach, though several criticized its graphics and presentation for being below-average. It spawned the Ace Combat franchise with several sequels, spin-offs, and other forms of media.
