Titolo: Quick, Draw!

Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Quick, Draw! is an online game developed by Google that challenges players to draw a picture of an object or idea and then uses a neural network artificial intelligence to guess what the drawings represent. The AI learns from each drawing, increasing its ability to guess correctly in the future. The game is similar to Pictionary in that the player only has a limited time to draw (20 seconds). The concepts that it guesses can be simple, like 'foot', or more complicated, like 'animal migration'.In a game of Quick, Draw!, there are six rounds. Before each round, the player is given 20 seconds to draw a randomized object selected from the game's database. As they begin each round, they have 20 seconds to draw the given prompt, whilst the artificial intelligence attempts to guess the drawing, akin to a game of Pictionary. A round ends either when the artificial intelligence successfully guesses the drawing or the player runs out of tights.
At the end of a Quick, Draw! game, the player is given their drawing and results. They can also check the artificial intelligence's comparison and guesses with other player-given objects, before either quitting or replanting.
