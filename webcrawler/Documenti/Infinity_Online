Titolo: Infinity Online

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Infinity Online is a free action MMOG created by the Korean software company Windysoft. It was supposed to be released on October 12, 2006, but due to an IDC problem, was released internationally on October 17. Gameplay is similar in style to Rakion with separate game rooms for players to enter, and players have the option of using a mouse and keyboard or a controller to control their character. There are both player versus player and mission modes where players cooperate to defeat AI enemies. The in-game currency is the luna. Game Tribe is currently working on the Europe version of Infinity Online.
For contractual and other reasons, Gametribe has implemented an IP block on users in the United States.
