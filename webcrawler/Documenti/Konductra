Descrizione: Konductra is a puzzle game for the Nintendo DS published by O~3 Entertainment. The game had an interesting development cycle, with IGN revealing the title on November 23, 2005. At the time independent developer oeFun had started work without having a publisher lined up. oeFun and O~3 came into a publishing agreement in the summer of 2006 after the title was finished.Multicoloured pairs of tiles have to be placed on a grid that is lined with 'conductors' by using the DS's stylus, with the aim of creating rows or blocks of the same colour. Once a row of tiles reaches the edge of the board, the pieces can be removed by drawing with the stylus through a conductor and along the chain. The game is also Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection enabled.
A sequel titled Konductra: Graveyard Shift was released for download on the Apple iOS on July 18, 2013.
