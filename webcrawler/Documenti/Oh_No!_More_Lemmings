Titolo: Oh No! More Lemmings

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Oh No! More Lemmings is an expansion pack to the puzzle video game Lemmings by DMA Design. It contains 100 unique single-player levels and six new music tracks. The Amiga version also includes 10 two-player levels. The game requires either the install disk from the previous Lemmings, or, in a standalone version, the game manual, for use as a copy protector. The new levels are separated into five difficulty categories (Tame, Crazy, Wild, Wicked, and Havoc), each with 20 levels.
The expansion received positive reviews for the uniqueness and the puzzles. Some reviewers, however, criticized it for the lack of fixes from the original title as well as the difficulty. The expansion was ported to many home computers and consoles.
