Titolo: Performan

Anno: 1985

Descrizione: Performan is an action arcade video game developed by Toaplan and published exclusively in Japan by Data East in April 1985. In the game, players assume the role of the titular robot in order to defeat enemies across multiple stages. The title is notable for being created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan as a result, as well as being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles.
