Upon release, Battlefield V received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay and new multiplayer modes but criticized for its shortage of content at launch and lack of innovation. The game sold 7.3 million copies by the end of 2018, but was a commercial disappointment for Electronic Arts.
