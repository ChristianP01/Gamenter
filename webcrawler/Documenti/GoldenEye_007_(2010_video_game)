It is a modern reimagining of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye as well as a remake of the 1997 video game of the same name, developed for the earlier Nintendo 64 console. The game was officially announced by Nintendo at their E3 2010 conference presentation. The game was released on 2 November 2010 in tandem with another James Bond game, Blood Stone. Nintendo, the publisher of the Nintendo 64 game, published the Wii version in Japan. It was the fourth 007 game developed by Eurocom and their second under Activision, after Quantum of Solace on the PlayStation 2 two years prior.

An enhanced port of the game, titled GoldenEye 007: Reloaded, was released in November 2011 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
