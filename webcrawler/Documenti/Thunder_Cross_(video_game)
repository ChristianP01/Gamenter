Titolo: Thunder Cross (video game)

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Thunder Cross (サンダークロス) is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game released by Konami in 1988. It used a "layered scrolling" background, a new 2D graphics technique at the time. The game spawned a sequel, Thunder Cross II, in 1991. Owing to several similarities, Space Manbow (1989) may also be considered a spin-off.
In 2007, Thunder Cross was included as part of the Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono budget series on the PlayStation 2 in Japan. It was later released as part of the Arcade Archives series on PlayStation 4 in Japan in 2017 and Nintendo Switch worldwide in 2021, and was added to Konami's Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Steam, and Nintendo Switch in 2019.
