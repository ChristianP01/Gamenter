Titolo: Persona 4 Arena Ultimax

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is a fighting video game co-developed by Atlus and Arc System Works. It was released for arcades in 2013, and for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2014 by Atlus in Japan and North America and by Sega in Europe. Versions for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 are planned to be released by Sega in March 2022. A direct sequel to Persona 4 Arena, the game is a spin-off from the Persona series, itself part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. Gameplay follows standard fighting game conventions, with matches between two characters with individual movesets, and special expendable abilities. The storyline is told through visual novel segments.
Arena Ultimax takes place immediately after Persona 4 Arena; Arena is set two months after the events of Persona 4, and three years after Persona 3. After a supernatural red fog covers the town of Inaba, the Investigation Team of Persona 4 team up with the Shadow Operatives—a group formed by the SEES of Persona 3—to uncover the truth behind the P-1 Grand Prix and confront Sho Minazuki, a hostile Persona user.
Arena Ultimax was intended as closure for the story of Arena, beginning production following the first game's critical and commercial success. The main staff of Arena returned for Arena Ultimax, with the gameplay being refined based on feedback. The release was supported by downloadable content featuring characters and accessories. Selling over 280,000 units worldwide, the game was positively reviewed by critics; many cited the gameplay as superior to its predecessor.
