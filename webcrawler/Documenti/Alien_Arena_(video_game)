Titolo: Alien Arena (video game)

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Alien Arena (initially CodeRED: Alien Arena) is a free, stand-alone first-person shooter computer game. Begun by COR Entertainment in 2004, the game combines a 1950s-era sci-fi atmosphere with gameplay similar to the Quake, Doom, and Unreal Tournament series. Alien Arena focuses mainly on online multiplayer action, although it does contain single-player matches against bots.
Alien Arena has been released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD. While the game's content is proprietary freeware, prohibiting commercial re-sale, the CRX engine is open source. In 2013 the assets license was loosened somewhat, which allowed the game package to be included in certain Linux distributions, such as Fedora.
