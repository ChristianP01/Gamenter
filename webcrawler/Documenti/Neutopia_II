Titolo: Neutopia II

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Neutopia II is a 1991 action-adventure video game developed and published in Japan by Hudson Soft and in North America by Turbo Technologies for the TurboGrafx-16. It is the sequel to Neutopia, which was released earlier in 1989. In the game, the player takes control of Jazeta's son, who embarks on a quest to both save his father and defeat the returning evil demon Dirth. 
Headed by director and designer Shigeki Fujiwara, Neutopia II was created by a mostly different team at Hudson Soft who did not work on the first Neutopia. First released on the TurboGrafx-16, the game has since been re-released through download services such as the Virtual Console and PlayStation Network download services, in addition of being included on the PC Engine Mini console. 
Neutopia II received mostly positive reception from critics since its release; praise was given to the varied monster designs, new gameplay additions, straightfoward plot and audiovisual presentation, while criticism was geared towards its lack of originality, simplistic puzzles and poor sprite animations, with some stating that the sequel felt indistinguishable from the first Neutopia. A third entry, Neutopia III, was teased by Hudson Soft but never materialized. Retrospective commentary has been equally positive, although some have criticized it as very derivative and imitative of The Legend of Zelda series.
