Titolo: Glory of the Roman Empire

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Glory of the Roman Empire is a 2006 city-building video game set during the age of the Roman Empire, developed by Haemimont Games. The game features a three-dimensional game engine and individual modeling of game character behaviors. The game was released in Spain and Italy in December 2006 by FX Interactive under the name Imperium Civitas. The difference in naming is explained by the popularity of Haemimont's previous games, Imperium I, II and III, which sold more than 1 million copies in these countries.
In the game, the player assumes the roles of city planner, governor, and military leader. Successful players will need planning skills, economic savvy, and—should those fail—military might. The glory of the Roman Empire will challenge gamers to grow a small village into a thriving community through trade with neighbors, while also expanding and defending its borders through more militaristic means. Players will need to focus on the physical and emotional health of the citizenry; as villagers age and mature under strong leadership, they contribute to the development of more advanced societies and larger cities.
A demo was released by Haemimont games on June 14, 2006, and a sequel - Imperium Romanum - was released in 2008.
