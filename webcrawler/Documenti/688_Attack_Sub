Titolo: 688 Attack Sub

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: 688 Attack Sub is a submarine simulator video game designed by John W. Ratcliff and Paul Grace, developed and published in 1989 for MS-DOS and in 1990 for Amiga by Electronic Arts. A Sega Genesis version was released in 1991 by Sega and was developed by MicroProse.

The player takes command of a US  Los Angeles-class or Soviet Alfa-class nuclear-powered attack submarine and plays ten missions ranging from into either Cold War scenarios or combat missions in a hypothetical global conflict.
As modeled in the game, the American submarine has more sophisticated electronics and more weapons. The Soviet boat has fewer weapons but higher sustained speeds.
This was one of the earliest games that allowed two players to play against each other over a modem (or null modem cable).Ratcliff and Grace later developed SSN-21 Seawolf, published in 1994.
