Titolo: Half-Life 2: Episode One

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Half-Life 2: Episode One is a first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve. It was originally released for Microsoft Windows in 2006, followed by Xbox 360 (as part of The Orange Box bundle) and PlayStation 3 in 2007. As the third entry in the Half-Life series, the game combines shooting, puzzle-solving and narrative, and is the first in a planned trilogy of shorter episodic games that continue the story of Half-Life 2 (2004). Players control scientist Gordon Freeman, who, alongside his companion Alyx Vance, must escape City 17 before an explosion destroys it.
Valve wanted to release new games quickly without spending years developing a major new product with new tools. For Episode One, they focused on the player's relationship with Alyx, developing her artificial intelligence. The game uses an updated version of Valve's Source engine, with new lighting and animation technology.
Episode One received mostly positive reviews; the co-operative gameplay with Alyx received particular praise, although the short length was criticized. The game was followed by Episode Two in 2007.
