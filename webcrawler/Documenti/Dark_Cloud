Titolo: Dark Cloud

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Dark Cloud is an action role-playing video game developed by Level-5 and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. Originally intended as a launch title for the system in March 2000, the game was eventually released in Japan in December 2000, in North America in May 2001, and in Europe in September 2001. A spiritual sequel, Dark Chronicle (called Dark Cloud 2 in North America), was released in Japan in 2002 and worldwide the following year.
Uniquely combining the mechanisms of action role-playing games with elements of city-building games, Dark Cloud tells the story of a group of adventurers who band together to fight against the Dark Genie, who has attacked and destroyed many villages. The main protagonist and player character is Toan, a boy who is given a magical stone called the Atlamillia by Simba, the Fairy King, granting him the power to rebuild the destroyed lands.
Dark Cloud was met with mainly positive reviews by critics, who praised its blend of gameplay types, although some criticized its combat as repetitive. The game was a commercial success. Although it initially sold poorly in Japan, it eventually went on to sell over 800,000 copies worldwide. In December 2015, the game was made available via emulation for the PlayStation 4 through the PlayStation Network.
