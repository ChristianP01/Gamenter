Descrizione: Go! Go! Kokopolo 3D: Space Recipe for Disaster is a 2017 action puzzle platform video game, and sequel to the 2011 DSiWare game Go! Go! Kokopolo: Harmonious Forest Revenge. Developed by Tanukii Studios Limited, and published by Circle Entertainment, the game features 80 new stages, 10 new bosses, a completely new story, as well as other bonus modes and secrets.Initially announced in June 2012, it was eventually released in North America on February 23, 2017, in PAL regions on March 30, 2017  and in Japan on October 11, 2017.The game continues the series' self-proclaimed "chase 'em up" tradition of gameplay, drawing inspiration from a variety of different gameplay styles and merging them to form a puzzle-platform-maze-game hybrid. Several criticisms of the original have been addressed and fixed here, such as a more lenient difficulty curve, increased viewing area to allow players more time to react to obstacles, and the removal of certain limitations of the lower screen gameplay.
