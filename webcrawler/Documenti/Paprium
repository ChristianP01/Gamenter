Titolo: Paprium

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Paprium is a 2020 homebrew side-scrolling beat 'em up video game developed and published by indie game studio WaterMelon for the Sega Mega Drive. This game is WaterMelon's first game since Pier Solar and the Great Architects and was announced as part of a crowd-funding pitch by WaterMelon directly on their "Magical Game Factory" crowd-funding site in 2012, with initial development starting sometime around 2013/2014.
Paprium underwent an eight year development cycle prior to its release, and with little to no communication from WaterMelon or any individual developers to the game's backers or to the press. Due to this, the game was widely seen as vaporware prior to the game's initial shipments at the end of 2020.
