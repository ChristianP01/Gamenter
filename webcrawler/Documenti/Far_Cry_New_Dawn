Descrizione: Far Cry New Dawn is a 2019 post-apocalyptic  first-person shooter developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. The game is a spin-off of the Far Cry series and a narrative sequel to Far Cry 5. As a result, it features many pre-existing gameplay elements from the series, including a large open world, capturing of outposts, and AI or co-op companions; it also introduces several elements from RPG gameplay, including an upgradeable home base and increased reliance on crafting from limited supplies. The story is set seventeen years after the events of Far Cry 5. After the nuclear exchange known as "the Collapse" devastated the world, survivors attempt to rebuild the community in Hope County.
It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in February 2019, and received generally mixed reviews from critics. The game's sales were lower than both Far Cry Primal and Far Cry 5.
