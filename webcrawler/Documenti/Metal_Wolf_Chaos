Titolo: Metal Wolf Chaos

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Metal Wolf Chaos is a third-person shooter video game developed and published by FromSoftware. It was released for the Xbox exclusively in Japan in 2004. The player takes on the role of fictional President of the United States Michael Wilson piloting a mech to battle the rebelling military led by fictional Vice President Richard Hawk. Wilson's mech can be equipped with up to eight weapons selected from a set of over a hundred. In each mission, the player battles through destructible environments, destroying all enemies they come across.
The Xbox's low popularity in Japan led Microsoft to team up with FromSoftware to develop a mecha game for the system. FromSoftware was primarily known at the time for the mecha combat series Armored Core. Since Microsoft was an American company, the team worked in extensive American context and cultural references. Though the game was only released in Japan, it grew a cult following in the West due to its exaggerated themes of American patriotism.
American publisher Devolver Digital began expressing interest in localizing the game in 2016. After positive fan response, FromSoftware producer Masanori Takeuchi began conversations with the company. Devolver Digital supported FromSoftware in publishing a remastered version of the game Metal Wolf Chaos XD for worldwide release on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One platforms on August 6, 2019.
