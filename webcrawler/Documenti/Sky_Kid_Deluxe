Descrizione: Sky Kid Deluxe (スカイキッドデラックス, Sukai Kiddo Derakkusu) is a horizontally scrolling shooter released in arcades by Namco in 1986. It is the sequel to Sky Kid, which was released in the previous year. It was the first game to run on the company's System 86 hardware. It was also the first game from the company to use a Yamaha YM2151 FM sound chip for its music. The gameplay is more difficult than the original, and it also introduces several new enemies and missions.
The game was re-released in the Japan-only Namco Collection for Microsoft Windows and received its first ever worldwide port to a console as part of Namco Museum Virtual Arcade for the Xbox 360, but did not include the second player's character Blue Max.
