Titolo: Endless Ages

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Endless Ages was a massively multiplayer online first person shooter with role playing elements, developed by American studio Avaria Corporation. When released for beta in Spring 2001 it was the first multiplayer online game to merge first person shooting and role-playing. The game had its official commercial release on July 1, 2003.The game features many elements such as character classes, quests, an auction system-based economy, and a player-versus-player combat system.
Originally developed and owned by Aaron Boucher and his independent Avaria Corporation, the game was sold as part of a game engine licensure agreement with Rapid Reality Studios, a now defunct game developer, who tried to improve it by creating a sequel named Phylon. The sequel was not well received, and in July 2007 the game went off-line. In May 2008, a former Endless Ages player and an investor, doing business as Digital Motion Entertainment, acquired the rights to the game and re-released it in something similar to its gold version, calling it Endless Ages Reborn.
