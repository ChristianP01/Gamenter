Titolo: Ethnic Cleansing (video game)

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Ethnic Cleansing is a first-person shooter video game for Microsoft Windows computers, created by the American white supremacist and hate organization National Alliance  (and published by its record label Resistance Records) on January 21, 2002. As part of a "Race War", the player controls a neo-Nazi skinhead or a Klansman and is tasked with killing stereotypical African, Mexican, and Jewish enemies, ending with then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
Using the Genesis3D engine, the National Alliance created the game to be provocative and to support their white supremacist message. The game has been controversial, with the Anti-Defamation League taking particular issue; it has been ranked several times as one of the most controversial games ever created. It was planned to be followed by a long line of sequels, but only one, titled White Law, was ever released.
