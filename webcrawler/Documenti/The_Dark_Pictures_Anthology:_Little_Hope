Titolo: The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope, also known simply as Little Hope, is a 2020 interactive drama survival horror video game developed by Supermassive Games and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is the second installment in The Dark Pictures Anthology series, succeeding Man of Medan which was released a year prior. Set in the fictional eponymous town located in Massachusetts, the game follows three timelines: the present day, 1972, and 1692â€”contemporaneous with the Salem witch trials. Four college students, chaperoned by their professor, explore the deserted Little Hope after their bus crashed by the area. Trapped within the town by an impenetrable fog, they come across visions of townspeople from Colonial Massachusetts, who were tried and executed due to suspicions of communing with the devil, and are subsequently pursued by demons whose appearances are reminiscent of the ways in which these townspeople died. Will Poulter stars as the game's leading actor and plays the role of one of the protagonists, named Andrew, as well as his doppelgangers Anthony and Abraham from 1972 and 1692, respectively.
The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on October 30, 2020. A successor, House of Ashes, was released in October 2021, starring the actress Ashley Tisdale.
