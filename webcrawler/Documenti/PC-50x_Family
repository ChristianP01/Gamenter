Titolo: PC-50x Family

Anno: 1975

Descrizione: The PC-50x Family (also known as SD-050, SD-070, SD-090, 9015) is a series of home video game consoles belonging to the first generation prevalent in Europe between 1977 and the early 1980s, all produced in Asia. The designation PC-50x of the series derives from the name of the cartridges (PC-501, PC-502 ...).
The consoles do not have a central processor; all the games are implemented thanks to the individual chips in the cartridges, all based on the chip family AY-3-8xxx of General Instrument. The family also includes the so-called "9015" series in which it changes the name (9015-A, 9015-B ...) and changes the shape of the cartridges but uses the same AY-3-8xxx chips.
