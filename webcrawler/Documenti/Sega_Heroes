Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Sega Heroes: Puzzle RPG Quest, better known as just Sega Heroes and formerly Sega Legends, was a free-to-play 2018 strategic mobile game published by Sega and Demiurge Studios. It was a role-playing puzzle game, featuring various Sega characters from multiple franchises and video games, including Phantasy Star, Jet Set Radio, Super Monkey Ball, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Altered Beast. It was the first mass-crossover Sega video game to not feature Ulala as a playable character. 
The game received mostly positive reviews from critics, many praising the strategic gameplay but criticizing its difficulty. On 16 April 2020, it was announced that Sega Heroes would be discontinued due to Demiurge Studios becoming independent from Sega. The discontinuation lead to additional bonus content in order for players to finish the game before the servers closed permanently, and recent in-app purchases being refunded to players. The game's servers were fully shut down on May 21, 2020.
