Descrizione: Maid of Sker () is a first-person survival horror game developed by Wales Interactive for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It was planned for release in 2019, but was pushed back and was released on 28 July 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One; the Nintendo Switch release was scheduled for later in 2020.
The game is set in 1898 in the Sker Hotel, on an imaginary island called Sker Island. The protagonist, Thomas Evans, is invited by his lover, Elisabeth Williams, to uncover the mysteries of the hotel after she notices her family's strange behavior. While exploring the hotel, Thomas learns cult followers called "The Quiet Ones" control the place. He finds notes and gramophone records scattered around the hotel that reveal the history of Elisabeth's family.
Several Welsh and British folklore tales provide inspiration for the story, specifically Sker House, a historic place situated just outside the town of Porthcawl, near Bridgend, Wales, made famous by The Maid of Sker, the three-volume novel written by R. D. Blackmore. The folklore story of the same name titled Y Ferch o'r Sger in Welsh also influenced the game. The game has been compared to Outlast, The Evil Within 2, Silent Hill. Its saving system was compared to that of Resident Evil, with the typewriter switched to a gramophone in the saving rooms.
Maid of Sker received "mixed or average" reviews from critics, the game was generally criticised for having bad gameplay mechanics and praised for the visuals and plot.
