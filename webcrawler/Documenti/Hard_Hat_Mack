Titolo: Hard Hat Mack

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Hard Hat Mack is a platform game developed by Michael Abbot and Matthew Alexander for the Apple II which was published by Electronic Arts in 1983. Ports for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 were released simultaneously.  It is part of the first batch of five games from Electronic Arts, and the company calls it out as "truly EA's first game."  Versions for the Amstrad CPC and IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk) followed in 1984.
Though not a direct clone, Hard Hat Mack is similar in theme and gameplay to Nintendo's 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game.
