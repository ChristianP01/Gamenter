Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Taxman is a clone of Namco's Pac-Man written by Brian Fitzgerald for the Apple II and published by H.A.L. Labs, a firm he cofounded with Greg Autry, in 1981.Featuring the same maze and yellow Pac-Man character as the arcade game, and promoted as "the definitive version of the popular game," HAL was asked to stop selling Taxman by Atari, Inc. who owned the home rights to Pac-Man. Atari published a modified version of Taxman as the official Apple II port of Pac-Man under its Atarisoft label. HAL Labs then changed the mazes and some of the graphics of Taxman and rebranded it as Taxman 2 in 1982.
Fitzgerald publicly released the Taxman source code in 2015.
