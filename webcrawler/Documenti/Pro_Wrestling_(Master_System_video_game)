Descrizione: Pro Wrestling, known as Gokuaku Doumei Dump Matsumoto (極悪同盟 ダンプ松) in Japan, is a professional wrestling video game released for the Sega Master System in 1986 by Sega. It centers around tag team wrestling, with four duos that players can select and guide to various championship titles around the world. Pro Wrestling was the only professional wrestling title released for the Master System in United States. The game has received mixed reviews, with publications criticizing the game's graphics and controls.
In Japan, the game is the home counterpart to the Sega arcade title Dump Matsumoto (released outside Japan as Body Slam). Like the arcade game, it features female wrestler Dump Matsumoto and her stable Gokuaku Doumei. In addition to having an entirely different, all-female roster, the Japanese version also has a final hidden matchup against aliens on another planet.
