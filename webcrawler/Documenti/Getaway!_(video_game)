Titolo: Getaway! (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Getaway! is a crime-themed, multidirectional-scrolling maze game for the Atari 8-bit family. It was designed by Mark Reid and published by the Atari Program Exchange (APX) in 1982. The game won the 1983 $25,000 Atari Star Award for best APX submission, but promotion of the game was affected by the video game crash of 1983. The Atari Program Exchange also sold 2 Ã— 3 foot posters of the Getaway! city map.
Reid, a chemical engineer, had two games published by APX prior to Getaway!: an implementation of Klondike Solitaire simply titled Solitaire, and the vertically scrolling skiing game Downhill.
