Titolo: Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball is a baseball video game released in North America during the years of 1991 and 1992 for the NES, Game Boy, Super NES, and Sega Genesis. All of the ballplayers have the likenesses and abilities of the 1991 Major League Baseball players they represent. However, since the game is not licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association, the only player whose name appears in the game is, of course, AL Cy Young Award Winner Roger Clemens. The 26 teams featured in the game correspond to the 1991 MLB teams as well, though team nicknames have been changed due to the lack of an MLB license as well.
In 1993, the game was released in Japan as MVP Baseball (ＭＶＰベースボール) and was only published for Nintendo's Game Boy and Super NES platforms.
Kingsley Thurber, the composer for Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball, also did the music for the Super NES version of Mortal Kombat along with Virtual Bart, Looney Tunes B-Ball and various WWF video games.
