Titolo: Jetpac Refuelled

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Jetpac Refuelled is an arcade-style shooter video game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Studios. It was released worldwide on the Xbox Live Arcade service on March 28, 2007. The game is the fourth installment of the Jetman series and a remake of Ultimate Play the Game's 1983 ZX Spectrum game, Jetpac. The game follows Jetman as he attempts to rebuild his rocket in order to explore different planets, whilst simultaneously defending himself from hostile aliens.
Details of the game were leaked in February 2007, shortly before Rare announced development one month later. During the development process, Rare attempted to ensure that the game did not feel too similar to the original Jetpac, while keeping the core mechanics. The game received mostly favorable reviews upon release. Critics praised the updated graphics and gameplay, however they criticized the overall repetitiveness of the game and its multiplayer mode. It was later rereleased as part of Rare's 2015 Xbox One compendium compilation Rare Replay, along with all three original Jetman games.
