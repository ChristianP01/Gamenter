Descrizione: Breakaway  is a soccer browser game developed by the Emergent Media Center at Champlain College and released during the 2010 FIFA World Cup as part of the United Nations Development Programme. The game is intended to educate children about gender issues: when the player makes gender equality-positive choices, the game enables the player's character to play better soccer.
Over 150 student developers have worked on the game since the Emergent Media Center began development in 2008. The students chose soccer because of the United Nations requirements. The developers found that the game had a positive impact on players' gender attitude; the game has also enabled mixed-gender soccer camps in multiple regions of the world.
