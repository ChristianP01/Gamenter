Descrizione: Formula One 2001 is a racing video game developed by Studio 33 for the PlayStation version and Studio Liverpool for the PlayStation 2 version and published by SCEE in Europe and 989 Sports in North America for PlayStation and PlayStation 2. It is a sequel to the 2000 video game Formula One 2000 and was based on the 2001 Formula One World Championship. This game is the last game to be released in North America until Formula One Championship Edition.
In some editions, a DVD was given for free. The DVD offers a commentated review of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, race by race, with the option to toggle between viewing the main stream, an on-board car camera, view the pitlane or see on-screen data such as lap times and positions. These features were used in the former pay-per-view F1 Digital+'s interactive coverage.
