Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Fast Draw Showdown is a live-action laserdisc video game, released by American Laser Games in 1994 (see 1994 in video gaming) for a limited number of platforms. As one of the last live-action rail shooters released by the company, which began the series with Mad Dog McCree, it is also arguably the shortest.

Global VR re-released the arcade game in 2002. It was also re-released for PC only by Digital Leisure in 2004 (see 2004 in video gaming), with mouse and light gun support.  This game was also re-released for WiiWare in North America on January 4, 2010 and in the PAL region on January 22, 2010. A HD port of this game was released for the PlayStation Network on the PlayStation 3 on July 19, 2011 and supported the PlayStation Move controller. A 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was announced but never released.
