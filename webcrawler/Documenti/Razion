Titolo: Razion

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Razion is a 2014 horizontally scrolling shooter video game developed and published by German indie team NG:Dev.Team for the Neo Geo. It is the fourth shoot 'em up title from NG:Dev.Team and their sixth game overall. Controlling a space fighter craft, the player must fight endless waves of enemies while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles.
First announced in mid-2014 for the Neo Geo, Razion bears resemblance to Fast Striker (2010), another shoot 'em up designed by NG:Dev.Team, due to its bullet hell-style approach. The music was composed by Andre Neumann, who previously scored music for DUX. Neumann was interested to score music for the game once he finished his work on Redux: Dark Matters, after Ren√© Hellwig told him that his brother Timm was looking for a musician who could make a psytrance soundtrack. A port for the Nintendo Switch under the title Razion EX was released in 2021, featuring several design changes compared to the original Neo Geo version.
