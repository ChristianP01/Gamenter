Descrizione: Malevolence: The Sword of Ahkranox is an action role-playing game from Australian indie developer "Visual Outbreak". The game is a turn-based, grid-based, first-person dungeon crawler inspired by classic 1980s and 1990s first person role-playing games. It was released to open beta on February 3, 2013 for Windows.
Malevolence: The Sword of Ahkranox is the first turn-based RPG to have a truly infinite game world that is both persistent and identical for all players. The engine makes use of procedural world generation to create an infinite in-game world which is the same for every player, meaning that separate players can find the same landmarks and NPCs. The development of the game was funded via Kickstarter.
