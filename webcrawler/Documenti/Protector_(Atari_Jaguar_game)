Titolo: Protector (Atari Jaguar game)

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Protector is a horizontally scrolling shooter developed by Bethesda Softworks and published by Songbird Productions for the Atari Jaguar on December 20, 1999. It is based on Søren Grønbech's 1989 Amiga game Datastorm, which in turn it was inspired by both Defender and Dropzone.When the inhabitants of the planetoid Haven-7 are under attack by a swarm of alien ships, the player is assigned to defend the minor planet and its people from the invasion by taking control of the Starblade spacecraft. Originally completed in 1995, Protector was released months after the Jaguar was declared as an open platform by Hasbro Interactive on the same year it was published. It was the first title released for the system by Songbird Productions.
Protector received positive reception since its release, with critics praising the game's graphics, sound, controls and gameplay, with some considering it superior to Jeff Minter's Defender 2000 but it was, however, criticized for the music by some reviewers and its unbalanced difficulty. Nevertheless, it has been referred by publications like PC Magazine and Retro Gamer as one of the best titles for the system. Due to its popularity, it received both a special edition and an expansion pack for the Atari Jaguar CD in 2002 and 2014 respectively. As of 2019, the special edition has sold over 500 copies, though it is unknown how many copies of the original version have been sold in total during its lifetime.
