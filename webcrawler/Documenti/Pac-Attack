Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Pac-Attack, also known as Pac-Panic, is a 1993 falling-tile puzzle video game developed and published by Namco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis. Versions for the Game Boy, Game Gear and Philips CD-i were also released. The player is tasked with clearing out blocks and ghosts without them stacking to the top of the playfield â€” blocks can be cleared by matching them in horizontal rows, while ghosts can be cleared by placing down a Pac-Man piece that can eat them. It is the first game in the Pac-Man series to be released exclusively for home platforms.
Pac-Attack is an adaptation of the 1992 game Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, which was released for arcades worldwide and the Super Famicom in Japan. Music was composed by Hiromi Shibano with cover art designed by Greg Martin. To promote the game's release, a contest was held in GameFan magazine that awarded cash prizes to players who submitted their highest scores. Critical reception for the game was mixed; while some disliked its lack of replay value and inferiority to games such as Tetris and Columns, others praised it for its addictiveness and clever usage of the traditional Pac-Man gameplay. It has been ported to several systems and included in a number of Pac-Man and Namco compilations for multiple platforms.
