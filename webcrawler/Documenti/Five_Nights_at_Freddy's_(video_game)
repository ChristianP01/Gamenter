Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Five Nights at Freddy's is a 2014 indie survival horror video game developed and published by Scott Cawthon. The game takes place in a fictional family pizza restaurant called "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza", where the player takes the role of a security guard who must defend themselves from the restaurant's animatronic characters that become mobile and homicidal at night.
Cawthon conceived the idea of the game after receiving criticism of his previous game, Chipper & Sons Lumber Co., for its unintentionally frightening characters that had animatronic-like movement. Developed in six months using the Clickteam Fusion 2.5 game engine, Five Nights at Freddy's was released for PC in August 2014 on Desura and Steam. The game was later made available on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
Upon release, the game received praise for its originality, simplicity, and atmosphere, quickly gaining a cult following. It was the top-selling game on Desura for the week ending August 18, 2014, and became the subject of numerous popular "Let's Play" YouTube videos. The game's success led to the launch of a media franchise, including several sequels, spin-offs, books, and merchandise, with a film adaptation in development. The game's popularity has also made it subject to numerous imitations and fangames.
