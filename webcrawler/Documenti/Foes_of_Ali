Titolo: Foes of Ali

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Foes of Ali is a boxing video game that was developed by Gray Matter and published by EA Sports in 1995. It was released exclusively for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer console. It was one of the first boxing games to render matches using 3D graphics. Thus, boxers in the game could be shown to move 360 degrees around the ring in a more convincing fashion than had previously been possible using 2D sprites. The gameplay bears many similarities to that featured in 4D Sports Boxing.
