Titolo: Charlie's Angels (video game)

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Charlie's Angels is a beat 'em up video game developed by Neko Entertainment and published by Ubi Soft for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It was to be ported to the Xbox, Game Boy Advance and Microsoft Windows; all three were cancelled.
Charlie's Angels is based on the 2000 film of the same name, itself based on the original 1970s television series created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts. The game follows the continuing adventures of three private investigators, Natalie Cook, Dylan Sanders, and Alex Munday, as they attempt to solve the mystery of a series of missing national monuments. The heroines do not use firearms but can utilize blunt weapons and certain environmental objects.
The game is notable for being panned by critics and has been regarded as one of the worst video games ever made.
