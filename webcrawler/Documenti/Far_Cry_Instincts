Titolo: Far Cry Instincts

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Far Cry Instincts is a 2005 first-person shooter game developed and published by Ubisoft for the Xbox. A remake of the original Microsoft Windows version of Far Cry, Instincts  is less open-ended and more linear, due to the console's reduced processing power which prevents the full rendering of the Microsoft Windows version's vast islands and landscape. However, Instincts added new multiplayer modes, weapons, and feral abilities, the latter being reflected in the modified storyline. A port of the game was also planned for the PlayStation 2, but was ultimately canceled.
An arcade version developed by Global VR was released in 2007 under the name Paradise Lost.Ubisoft has released a sequel, Far Cry Instincts: Evolution for the Xbox. Also released was Far Cry Instincts: Predator for the Xbox 360, which contains both Far Cry Instincts and Evolution running in high definition mode.
