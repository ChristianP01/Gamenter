Titolo: The Beverly Hillbillies (video game)

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: The Beverly Hillbillies is a 1993 video game developed by Synergistic Software and published by Capstone Software, released in conjunction with the 1993 film of the same name (itself a remake of the 1960s television show). The game, a point-and-click adventure, tells the story of the Clampetts, a poor family in the Ozarks who discover oil on their property and become millionaires, moving to Beverly Hills with their newfound wealth. Despite being a tie-in to the film, the game shares only vague similarities in plot.
Poorly received at its release, The Beverly Hillbillies has since been mentioned as one of the worst video games ever made because of its frustrating puzzles and numerous bugs.
