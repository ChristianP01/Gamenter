Descrizione: Custom Robo GX is a sci-fi action role-playing game developed by NOISE, and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance on July 26, 2002 in Japan. Nintendo considered releasing the game in North America, but never did, for unknown reasons. The game stayed on Nintendo Power's future release list for a few years, until the release of the next title of the series, Custom Robo: Battle Revolution for the Nintendo GameCube (known as Custom Robo in North America). NOISE also planned the sequel Custom Robo GX 2, but later dropped it in favor of Custom Robo Arena for the Nintendo DS. Nintendo previously planned to release it in late 2005 in Japan. Custom Robo GX is the third title of the Custom Robo series as well as the last Custom Robo title never released outside Japan.
