Titolo: Hard Drivin'

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Hard Drivin' is a 1989 driving video game developed by Atari Games. It invites players to test drive a sports car on courses that emphasize stunts and speed. The game features one of the first 3D polygon driving environments via a simulator cabinet with a force feedback steering wheel and using a custom rendering architecture. According to the in-game credit screen, Hard Drivin' was designed by two teams working concurrently in the United States and Ireland.
Hard Drivin' was released in arcades in February 1989, when driving games were largely implemented with scaled 2D sprites and when filled-polygon 3D graphics of any kind were rare in games. It is the second commercially released arcade racing game to use 3D polygons; Namco's Winning Run was released two months earlier.
In total, there are fifteen variations of the arcade unit. The eleven cockpit and four compact machines included various British, German, and Japanese versions.
