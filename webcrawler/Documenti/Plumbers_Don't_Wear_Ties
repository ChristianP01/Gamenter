Titolo: Plumbers Don't Wear Ties

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Plumbers Don't Wear Ties is an adult-oriented "romantic comedy" visual novel/dating sim developed by United Pixtures and published by Kirin Entertainment for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Although the game did have a DOS version, it had very limited distribution and was published by United Pixtures itself. The game stars Edward J. Foster and Jeanne Basone as John and Jane, respectively; two people who are being pressured by their respective parents to go out and find a spouse. The player's task is to get John and Jane together.
Plumbers Don't Wear Ties received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics for its lackluster production value, nonsensical storyline, poor acting and humor, and for primarily being presented as a slideshow despite being advertised as a full motion video game. It is widely considered one of the worst video games of all time.
At E3 2021, a re-release of the game for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 was announced by Limited Run Games.
