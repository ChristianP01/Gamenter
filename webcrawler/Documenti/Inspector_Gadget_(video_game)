Titolo: Inspector Gadget (video game)

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Inspector Gadget is a 1993 side-scrolling action video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System based on the television show of the same title. The game was released by Hudson Soft, with developers who also worked on Hudson's video game adaptations SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron and An American Tail: Fievel Goes West.
The normally bumbling Gadget is portrayed as fairly competent as he must rescue his niece Penny from the clutches of Dr. Claw and his M.A.D. terrorist organization. Dr. Claw's face makes a rare appearance in the game, unlike the cartoon, which keeps his face hidden. A hidden debug menu is used to test certain options like god mode, a stage select with every playable level available, and a complete test of all the sound effects/music found while playing the game.
