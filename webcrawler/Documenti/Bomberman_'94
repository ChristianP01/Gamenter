The game supports single-player and multi-player modes. In single player, the player navigates several levels of mazes, destroying creatures with bombs. In multiplayer mode, players defeat each other with bombs.
The Mega Drive/Genesis port had some differences, such as fewer options in multi-player, and some different music (for example, Jammin' Jungle's music in the original version was reused as the first level in Super Bomberman 4, but is entirely different in the other version).

The previous game, Bomberman '93, was made available instead when Bomberman '94 was released in Japan's Virtual Console.Bomberman '94 was released on the Japanese PlayStation Network on July 15, 2009 for play on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. It was later released in North America on June 2, 2011.
