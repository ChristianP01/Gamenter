Titolo: Air Assault Task Force

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Air Assault Task Force is a computer wargame developed by ProSIM Company and published by Shrapnel Games.  The lead developer was ProSIM Company founder, Pat Proctor. Other developers included Gary Bezant (The Falklands War: 1982) and Curt Pangracs (The Star and the Crescent).Air Assault Task Force is a combat simulator and includes four campaigns, set at the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, LA, at LZ X-Ray during the Vietnam War, in the ill-fated Ranger raid in Mogadishu, Somalia (the famous "Black Hawk Down" incident), and Operation Anaconda during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The game built on the pausable real-time gameplay of ProSIM's BCT Commander and the AI and hierarchy system of Armored Task Force. In addition to a major upgrade to these earlier game systems, it also includes a graphical and GUI overhaul that makes the game's graphics better.
In 2007, defense contractor Boeing commissioned ProSIM to create a custom version of the game for use as a ground combat simulator, to be paired with an intelligent tutor and after-action review agent application developed by Boeing.
