Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Links LS 2000 is a golf video game developed by Access Software and published by Microsoft. It is part of the Links series and was released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, and in 2000 for Macintosh. It was followed by Links 2001.
Links LS 2000 was viewed by critics as a minimally upgraded version of its predecessor, Links LS 1999. It was praised for its multiplayer, variety, and game physics, but critics felt that rival golf games such as Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge were superior, in part because of their inclusion of a golf course designer. Links LS 2000 was the sixth best-selling computer sports game of 1999, with 104,225 units sold.
An add-on program with additional courses, titled Links LS 2000 10-Course Pack, was released in 2000. Links LS Classic, released later in 2000, is a version of Links LS 2000 that includes 21 championship courses.
