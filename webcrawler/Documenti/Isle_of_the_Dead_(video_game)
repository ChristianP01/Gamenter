Titolo: Isle of the Dead (video game)

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Isle of the Dead is a point-and-click first-person shooter horror video game developed by Rainmaker Software and published by Merit Software in 1993 for IBM and compatibles. The game centers around Jake Dunbar, the sole survivor of a plane crash, on a mysterious tropical island inhabited by zombies under the control of a mad scientist. Dunbar can interact with non-player characters to acquire weapons and obtain items through adventure game commands.
Originally planned to be a hack-and-slash game, Isle of the Dead was made to have the feel of horror pulp comics. A minicomic was included with the game on release. Reception to the game was negative, both on release and in retrospectives. Criticism was given to its graphics, in-game map, and structure. Publications, such as Computer Gaming World, have called it one of the worst video games of all time.
