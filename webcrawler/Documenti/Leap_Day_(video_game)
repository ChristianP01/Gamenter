Descrizione: Leap Day is a 2D level-based platform game developed and published by Nitrome, first released for iOS and Android on May 11, 2016. Players must reach a Gold Cup at top of a procedurally generated level by controlling a character which runs automatically, tapping on the screen to make the character jump in order to collect fruits, dodge enemies and hazards, and progress through the level. A new level is generated every day, with levels from previous days available to play after watching an advertisement.
A sequel, titled Super Leap Day, was released for iOS, macOS, and tvOS devices on August 6, 2021, as part of the Apple Arcade subscription service. It features gameplay improvements, horizontal levels, and an updated vector art style, which differs from the pixel art used in the first game.
