Titolo: Fight Night Champion

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Fight Night Champion is a boxing video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts. It is the fifth and last entry in the Fight Night series and was released on March 1, 2011  for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game takes a drastic turn from its predecessors, depicting a "grittier", "darker" setting with animations and player damage that "truly conveys the brutality of the sport of boxing." The violence and strong language in the game's story mode earned it a Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board, the only EA Sports title to do so.
The game was officially revealed on 7 July 2010 at an EA Sports studio showcase. It was added to Xbox One's catalog of backward compatible titles in May 2018. The game is the first EA Sports game to feature a full Hollywood-inspired story mode, called Champion Mode. The story follows the career of Andre Bishop, a talented boxer, who is forced to overcome great setbacks including a prison sentence and a corrupt fight promoter. Champion Mode is intended to further convey the brutality and hardship of the sport of boxing.
An iOS version of the game, developed by HB Studios, was released alongside the console versions.
The new direction of the gameplay was highly praised by critics, with the game being released to positive reviews.
