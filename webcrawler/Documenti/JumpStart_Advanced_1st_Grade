Titolo: JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade is a personal computer game created by Knowledge Adventure. It replaced the previous JumpStart 1st Grade released in 1995 and updated in 2000. As its name suggests, it was made to teach first grade students. From 2003â€“2008, it was distributed as the "Fundamentals" disc in a 3- or 4-disc package of the same name, though recently a factory error caused many JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade packages to instead contain JumpStart 3D Virtual World: Trouble in Town going by the same name.
