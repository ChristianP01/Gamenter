Titolo: Legends of Runeterra

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Legends of Runeterra (LoR) is a 2020 digital collectible card game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by the physical collectible card game Magic: The Gathering, the developers sought to create a game within the same genre that significantly lowered the barrier to entry. Since its release in April 2020, the game has been free-to-play, and is monetised through purchasable cosmetics. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and mobile operating systems iOS and Android.
Like other collectible card games, players play one versus one to reduce their opponent's health to zero. Cards come in a variety of types and belong to one of ten regionsâ€”groups of cards with a similar gameplay identity. One significant feature is the game's combat pacing; unlike in other collectible card games, each player alternates between attacking and defending every turn.
Many characters from League of Legends, a multiplayer online battle arena by Riot Games, feature in the game. The fictional universe of Runeterra, released by the developer through short stories, comic books, and an animated series, provides flavor and theming for the game's cards.
Legends of Runeterra has been well received by critics, who point to its generous progression systems, accessible gameplay, and high-quality visuals, and has won several industry awards.
