Titolo: Kuri Kinton

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Kuri Kinton (功里金団) is a side-scrolling beat 'em up arcade game published by Taito. Players control a Chinese policeman who must dispatch numerous enemies while progressing through the game's levels.
The object of the game is to rescue a senior policeman and his daughter, both of whom have been kidnapped by a gang and spirited away to an underground hideout.
The most interesting thing about this game is that it is freely (and not officially) inspired from two popular manga of this period:
Dragon Ball, for the main character' aspect and powers (can throw kamehamehas and uses a sort of Kaïo-Ken).
Hokuto No Ken, for bosses' aspect and technics they use.
Video game adaptations of these two manga were rare in 1988 (apart from NES and Master System), that's why the game was somehow (and is still) popular among a category of players.
The game received though a mixed response from games critics.
