Descrizione: Lemmings Paintball is an action video game from the Lemmings franchise made by Visual Science and published by Psygnosis in 1996.
Unlike most of the Lemmings games, it does not use a side-scrolling perspective but instead an isometric view of the levels. The gameplay is also very different from other Lemmings games, focusing on splattering enemies with paint from a gun. The levels contain various puzzles including moving platforms, lemming catapults, and trampolines.
Lemmings Paintball was known as Lemmings Play Paintball during development.
