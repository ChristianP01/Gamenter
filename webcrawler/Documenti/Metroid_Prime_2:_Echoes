Titolo: Metroid Prime 2: Echoes

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is an action-adventure game developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. The sequel to Metroid Prime (2002) and the first Metroid game with a multiplayer feature, Echoes was released in North America, Europe and Australia in 2004 and in Japan under the name Metroid Prime 2: Dark Echoes in May 2005.
The story of Echoes follows bounty hunter Samus Aran after she is sent to rescue Galactic Federation Marines from a ship near Aether, a planet inhabited by a race known as the Luminoth. She discovers that the troops were slaughtered by the Ing, a hostile race that came from an alternate dimension of Aether. Samus must travel to four temples to ensure the destruction of the Ing, while battling the Ing, wild creatures, Space Pirates, and her mysterious doppelg√§nger Dark Samus.
Retro sought to differentiate the game from its predecessor, with a heavier focus on storytelling and new gameplay mechanics. Nintendo launched a viral marketing campaign to promote the game that included several websites written as if taking place in the Metroid universe. The game's single-player mode was acclaimed by critics, citing its graphics, atmosphere and music, though its steep difficulty and multiplayer mode were met less positively. Since its release, Echoes has received several video game industry awards, as well as spots on "top games" lists by Nintendo Power and IGN. Over 800,000 copies of the game were sold worldwide. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for Wii as a standalone game in Japan and as part of Metroid Prime: Trilogy internationally.
