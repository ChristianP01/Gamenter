Titolo: Minetest

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Minetest is a free and open-source  sandbox video game and game creation system developed by a team of volunteers, with significant contributions from the community. The first publicly available version was Minetest 0.0.1, created by Perttu Ahola, and released on the Web in November 2010. Minetest is programmed in C++ using the Irrlicht Engine, and is available for Linux-based systems, FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Android. Minetest provides an API for users to create their own games and mods written in Lua.
In Minetest, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with seemingly infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures and landscapes. Depending on game mode and mods present, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world.
The game mechanics of Minetest are similar to those of the 2009 game Minecraft, though the original author stopped just short of describing it as a "Minecraft clone". Over a decade of active development Minetest has garnered critical acclaim and gained in popularity; since November 2013 Minetest has been downloaded over 1.4 million times from GitHub, and the Android version of Minetest has over 500 thousand downloads on the Google Play store. Minetest has also been used in school education to teach abstract thinking and as an interactive visualization tool. Minetest is free software since November 29, 2010, allowing users to study and modify both the source code and the included art.
