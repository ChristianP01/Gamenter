Descrizione: Echochrome, is a 2008 puzzle game created by Sony's Japan Studio and Game Yarouze, which is available for PlayStation 3 from the PlayStation Store and for PlayStation Portable (PSP) on either UMD or from the PlayStation Store. Gameplay involves a mannequin figure traversing a rotatable world where physics and reality depend on perspective. The world is occupied by Oscar Reutersvärd's impossible constructions. This concept is inspired by M. C. Escher's artwork, such as "Relativity". The game is based on the Object Locative Environment Coordinate System developed by Jun Fujiki—an engine that determines what is occurring based on the camera's perspective.
A sequel to the game, Echochrome II, was released for the PlayStation 3 utilizing the PlayStation Move in December 2010. A spinoff was released on the PlayStation Portable in 2009 titled Echoshift.
