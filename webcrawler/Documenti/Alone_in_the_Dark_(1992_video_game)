Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Alone in the Dark is a survival horror video game designed by Frédérick Raynal and developed and published by Infogrames for the PC. Alone in the Dark was released for MS-DOS in 1992, ported for the 3DO by Krisalis in 1994, and ported for iOS by Atari, Inc. in 2014. Set in 1920s Louisiana, the game challenges the player to guide the player character out of a haunted mansion, advancing by solving puzzles while either banishing, slaying, or eluding various ghosts and monsters. The player can collect and use weapons, manage a weight-based inventory system, and explore a partially nonlinear map.
Alone in the Dark received critical acclaim upon its release, and is considered a breakthrough and influential title, as it was the first 3D survival horror game. In the years since its release, many commentators have dropped the 3D qualifier and asserted that Alone in the Dark was the first survival horror game regardless of graphical perspective. Among the accolades that followed its release, Alone in the Dark received the European Computer Trade Show awards for Best Graphics and Most Original Game in 1993. In 2009, Empire included Alone in the Dark on their list of 100 greatest video games of all time.
Alone in the Dark is considered a forefather, and often the originator, of the survival horror genre, and it strongly influenced Shinji Mikami's direction of the original Resident Evil game, as well as the franchise as a whole. Alone in the Dark has also spawned four follow-up games as part of the series, as well as two films loosely based on them.
