Titolo: Rain (video game)

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Rain (stylized as rain), known in Asia as Lost in the Rain, is an adventure video game developed by Acquire and Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. The game was revealed at Gamescom and was released as a digital download on the PlayStation Network in 2013. While the digital version is available in all regions, the game's physical disc based release was limited to in Japan, with only Japanese language options, and a Hong Kong and Taiwan release containing English and Traditional Chinese  language options. This last version is the only way to acquire an English language copy of the game in physical form, making it a sought after collectible. The game is centred around a novel mechanic whereby the player's character and all enemies are only visible if they are standing in the rain.
