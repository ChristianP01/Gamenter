Two attempts to localize the game for the United States market have been made since August 2008, including UBeat, a variant of the first version, and Jukebeat in 2009, a variant based on Jubeat Ripples.A port of the game for the iOS, Jubeat Plus, was released on Apple's Japanese App Store in 2010, with a release in the US store, retitled Jukebeat like the 2009 location test, in 2011.
On April 1, 2021, Konami announced a major overhaul to Jubeat Plus via the official Jubeat Twitter account, rebranding it as Jubeat. On May 7, 2021, it was launched as a successor to both Jukebeat and Jubeat Plus on both Android and iOS.
