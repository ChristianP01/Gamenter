Descrizione: Arc the Lad: Twilight of the Spirits ("アークザラッド 精霊の黄昏" Āku za Raddo: Seirei no Tasogare, also known as Arc: Twilight of the Spirits in Europe) is a 2003 tactical role-playing video game developed by Cattle Call and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the sixth game released in the Arc the Lad series, and the first game in the series released for the PlayStation 2 and made in 3D. It originally released in Japan on March 2003, alongside a premium box set, later in June 2003 in North America (marking it the first game in the series to be published by Sony in the region), and later in January 2004 in Europe (marking it as the first game in the series to release in the region). The game was executively produced by Tekken creator, Seiichi Ishii, and received developmental support by certain members of Zener Works Inc, developers of Okage: Shadow King. It was followed up with a sequel in 2005, Arc the Lad: End of Darkness.
Taking place 1,000 years after Arc the Lad III, Twilight of the Spirits follows two races, human and Deimos (Mazoku (魔族, Demon clan) in the Japanese version), who have had centuries long conflicts regarding displacement and human use of the magical Spirit Stones to their power machinery while Deimos use it as their life force. The game's plot follows an intersecting storyline between human and Deimos hybrid twin brothers, Kharg and Darc, who attempt to locate the five Great Spirit Stones for their own ambitions while crossing paths with the autocratic Dilzweld Army, who plan to use the stones to take over the world, and a mysterious girl who is linked to all three.
Twilight of the Spirits received average-to-positive reception from critics upon release. It received praise for its battle system, interconnecting storyline, and music, but criticism for its voice acting, lack of sidequests, and balancing.
