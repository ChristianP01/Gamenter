Descrizione: Big Run is a rally racing arcade video game released by Jaleco in 1989. Rendered in 3D, the game is the first to be set in the Paris-Dakar rally raid which the player drives a Porsche 959, resembling that of the 1986 winner.  Opponents in the game resemble Peugeot 205 T16s, which went on to win in the 1987 Paris-Dakar rally, with Mitsubishi Pajeros also appearing occasionally.
There are two games in the series: Big Run - The Supreme 4WD Challenge - 11e Rallye (1989) and Big Run - The Supreme 4WD Challenge - 13e Rallye (1991, Super Famicom)
Big Run was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST.
