Descrizione: Bayonetta 2 is a 2014 action-adventure game developed by PlatinumGames and published by Nintendo. It is the sequel to the 2009 game Bayonetta, and was directed by Yusuke Hashimoto and produced by Atsushi Inaba and Hitoshi Yamagami, under supervision by series creator Hideki Kamiya.Bayonetta 2 was announced in a Nintendo Direct presentation on September 13, 2012.  Unlike the Sega-published Bayonetta, which was a multiplatform release for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a publishing deal with Nintendo meant that Bayonetta 2 released as a platform-exclusive for Wii U. The titular character, Bayonetta, sports a new costume and hairstyle and the game features a new two-player mode. The game is the second Bayonetta product to receive Japanese voiceovers, using the same cast that voiced the Bayonetta: Bloody Fate anime film by Gonzo.Bayonetta 2 was released in September 2014 in Japan and October 2014 for the rest of the world. The Special and First Print Editions of the game included a Wii U port of the original Bayonetta as a separate disc inside the case. The game received critical acclaim from many reviewers, praising the combat system and overall improvements from the first game.
Nintendo Switch ports of both games, and a sequel, Bayonetta 3, were announced in December 2017 during The Game Awards 2017.
