Titolo: The Dallas Quest

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: The Dallas Quest is a graphic adventure game based on the soap opera Dallas. The game was programmed by James Garon for the TRS-80  Color Computer and published by Datasoft in 1984.  It was ported to the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. The game uses the same split-screen presentation as Datasoft's earlier The Sands of Egypt. After an initial sequence at Southfork Ranch, The Dallas Quest has little to do with the TV show.
