Descrizione: DeathSpank,  also known as DeathSpank: Orphans of Justice, is a comedy action role-playing game created by game designers Ron Gilbert and Clayton Kauzlaric. It was developed by Hothead Games and published by Electronic Arts.  The game was released on July 13, 2010 on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and on July 14, 2010 on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade.  The Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X versions were released October 26, 2010 and December 14, 2010 respectively, via Steam.
DeathSpank follows the titular character DeathSpank in his quest to find an item known as The Artifact.  The game was originally supposed to be the first of a two-part series.  The second half of the series, entitled DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue was first released on September 20, 2010.  Gilbert described DeathSpank as being "Act I" in the story, and Thongs of Virtue as being "Acts II and III". However, it was later announced that Deathspank was returning for a third game entitled, The Baconing, abandoning the protagonist's name in its title. The third game was released on August 30, 2011.
DeathSpank has received generally positive reviews from critics, who cited influences from both the Monkey Island and Diablo games.
