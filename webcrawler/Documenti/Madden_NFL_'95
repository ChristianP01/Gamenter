Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Madden NFL 95 is a football video game released by Electronic Arts in 1994. In addition to the usual home console versions that were released on the Sega Genesis and Super NES, this edition was also released for the portable Game Gear and Game Boy systems (although the Game Boy was released without the NFL license as Madden '95). It was the first version of the game that portrayed black NFL players as black, rather than all white as in previous versions, and the first sports game to portray black athletes on the cover.
