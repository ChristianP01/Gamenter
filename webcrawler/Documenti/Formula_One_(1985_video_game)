Descrizione: Formula One is a Formula One racing management video game published in 1985 by CRL Group PLC. It was developed by G.B. Munday and B.P. Wheelhouse for the ZX Spectrum, and converted to Amstrad CPC by Richard Taylor.
The game sets the player as the Formula One team manager on a team of choice, starting on the season of 1985 and onwards. The player is in charge of all the decisions regarding drivers, sponsors, budget management, chassis and engine improvements, tires selection, among others, during the sixteen races comprised. The game uses hotseat multiplayer for up to six players, each managing a different team, and five different levels of difficulty for the CPU-controlled teams.
Formula One was one of the first games of its genre, following its predecessor Grand Prix Manager by Silicon Joy, and was in well received by critics.
