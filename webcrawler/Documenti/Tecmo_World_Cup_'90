Descrizione: Tecmo World Cup '90 is an association football video game released by Tecmo for arcades in 1989. It was an arcade successor to Tecmo's Tehkan World Cup (1985), and is based on the 1990 FIFA World Cup.
An unofficial bootleg of the game named Euro League featuring European club teams was also released.
