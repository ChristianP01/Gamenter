Descrizione: Metal Walker, known as Bakusou Senki Metal Walker GB: Kotetsu no Yuujou (爆走戦記 メタルウォーカーGB 鋼鉄の友情, lit. "Roaring Chronicle Metal Walker GB: Steel Friendship") in Japan, is a role-playing video game for the Game Boy Color, developed and published by Capcom. Many critics likened the game to the Pokémon series, but praised the game's unique qualities. In Japan, the game inspired merchandise based on the Metal Walker robots.Metal Walker's battles are unique from other games in the genre due to their billiard-style nature. Players move their Metal Walkers across the battlefield by hitting them into items, walls, or enemy Metal Walkers.
The 2013 mobile game Monster Strike has a similar concept and gameplay mechanics but is otherwise unconnected to Metal Walker.
