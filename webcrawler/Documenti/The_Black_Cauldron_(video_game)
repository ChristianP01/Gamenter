Titolo: The Black Cauldron (video game)

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: The Black Cauldron is an adventure game designed by Al Lowe of Sierra On-Line and released in 1986. The game is based on the Disney film The Black Cauldron, which was itself based on the Chronicles of Prydain novel of the same name by Lloyd Alexander. It was made shortly after the first King's Quest game, so it resembles that adventure in many ways. Along with The Dark Crystal it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.
