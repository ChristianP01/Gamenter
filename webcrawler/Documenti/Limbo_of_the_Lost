Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Limbo of the Lost is a 2008 point-and-click adventure game developed by Majestic Studios for the PC. The game follows Benjamin Briggs, the real life captain of the Mary Celeste, as he explores Limbo. Players act as an omnipresent guide for Briggs during his adventure.
Development on Limbo of the Lost began in the early 1990s as graphical text adventure genre for the Atari ST and Amiga 500. Due to lessening demand of these platforms, the game was initially shelved, but later redeveloped for the PC during the 2000s. A few months after its 2008 release, Limbo of the Lost was withdrawn from sale when it was discovered that the game plagiarized content from other titles.
