Titolo: Dead or Alive: Dimensions

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Dead or Alive: Dimensions (DOAD) is a fighting game developed by Team Ninja and released by Tecmo Koei and in some regions by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS in 2011. Originally planned as a launch title for the 3DS but delayed due to 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, DOAD makes use of the console's unique features. The game was well received by critics.
Dimensions can be considered a compilation game rather than a truly new entry in the Dead or Alive series, similar to the likes of Mortal Kombat Trilogy or Tekken Tag Tournament. It offers 26 playable fighters, more than any previous installment in the franchise, and uses a modified engine of Dead or Alive 4. Its plot compiles the stories of the previous four main DOA games, focusing on Kasumi for 1, Ryu Hayabusa for 2, Ayane for 3, and Helena for 4.
Dimensions was the first DOA game to be released on a Nintendo system, the first one not fully published by Tecmo (it was jointly published with Nintendo in Europe and Australia), the first DOA fighting game released on a handheld, and most notably, the first released without any involvement from series creator Tomonobu Itagaki. It was also the first game in the series to have a "Teen" rating from the ESRB since Dead or Alive 3 by toning down the sexual content for female characters; nevertheless, the game was not distributed in Sweden and consequently in all Scandinavia, and experienced problems with being released in Australia as well.
