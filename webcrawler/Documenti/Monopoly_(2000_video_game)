Titolo: Monopoly (2000 video game)

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Monopoly is a 1999 computer game based on the board game Monopoly, released for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh. Developed by Artech Studios, it was published by Hasbro Interactive, Inc. for Windows and MacSoft for the Mac. This title was one of many inspired by the property-dealing board game. It uses the same box art as a 1998 reissue of the 1995 Monopoly PC game. This game proved to be popular and was re-released as Monopoly New Edition (also known as Monopoly 3) on September 30, 2002, published by Infogrames. The only major difference between this game and its re-release was the absence of the board editor in Monopoly 3. A PlayStation Portable version of this game was released in 2008.
