Titolo: Magic: The Gathering Online

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Magic: The Gathering Online is a video game adaptation of Magic: The Gathering, utilizing the concept of a virtual economy to preserve the collectible aspect of the card game. It is played through an Internet service operated by Wizards of the Coast, which went live on June 24, 2002. The game does not run on mobile (iOS or Android) as Magic: the Gathering Arena does, since it is only install-able on Microsoft Windows. Users can play the game or trade cards with other users.
As of February 2007, Magic Online has over 300,000 registered accounts; this does not represent the true number of players since people are allowed to register multiple accounts. According to Worth Wollpert in 2007, Magic Online was "somewhere between 30% to 50% of the total Magic business."
