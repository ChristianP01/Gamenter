Besides controlling the two playable characters across a single scenario, the player is able to recruit creatures known as Dream Eaters that are able to assist in fights.
The Square Enix staff decided to develop Dream Drop Distance after being impressed by the quality of the Nintendo 3DS. Taking advantage of the console's functions, they increased the action elements from the series based on the system previously seen in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. Additionally, both the gameplay and the plot are meant to give a glimpse about what the following title in the series, Kingdom Hearts III, would be like. The game has been well received in Japan and in the US, selling over 250,000 and 180,000 units on its debuts respectively. Critics generally praised the gameplay and graphics, while criticizing aspects of the plot.
A high-definition remaster of the game entitled Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance HD was released for the PlayStation 4 in 2017 and Xbox One in 2020 as part of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue compilation.
