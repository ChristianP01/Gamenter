Titolo: Air Gallet

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Air Gallet is a 1996 vertical-scrolling shooter arcade game published by Banpresto. Players control a fighter jet through six level to destroy a terrorist organization, who are destroying major worldwide cities and brainwashing the world's population with propaganda. Its gameplay involves destroying waves of enemies, picking up power-ups and new weapons, and destroying bosses.
Air Gallet was developed by Gazelle, an off-shoot of defunct developer Toaplan. It was directed by Tatsuya Uemura and designed by Junya Inoue, who wanted it to have a more boisterous presentation compared to his previous works. Gazelle's financial difficulties and strict time schedules forced its development to be hastily rushed. The game was released to mixed reviews; while its graphics and sprite layering techniques were praised, critics felt that it wasn't as polished or innovative as other, similar games were. Inoue has since expressed his disappointment in its quality.
