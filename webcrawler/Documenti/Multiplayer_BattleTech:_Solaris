Titolo: Multiplayer BattleTech: Solaris

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Multiplayer BattleTech: Solaris is a version of the multiplayer BattleTech computer game which was available on AOL, and on Kesmai's (later named GameStorm) game service between 1996 and 2001. At its height on the AOL server, thousands of players competed simultaneously in arenas of two to eight participants, battling in team games or free-for-alls. After AOL initiated its hourly pay-for-play system, the majority of players moved to the GameStorm service, which operated for a number of years until its purchase by Electronic Arts.
During its run, the game's player-driven community grouped themselves into armies representing the various Successor States, or independent stables, or mercenary units.  Though the in-game software did not support official groups, the player-driven units became close-knit communities, even after the games cancellation in 2001.
The game was a follow-up to Multiplayer BattleTech: EGA; it was in turn succeeded by Multiplayer BattleTech 3025.
