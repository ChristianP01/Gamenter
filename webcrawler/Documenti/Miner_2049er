Titolo: Miner 2049er

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Miner 2049er is a platform video game created by Bill Hogue that was released in 1982 by Big Five Software. It was developed for the Atari 8-bit family and widely ported to other systems. The title "Miner 2049er" evokes a 21st-century take on the California Gold Rush of around 1849, in which the gold miners and prospectors were nicknamed "49ers".A key selling point of the game was having ten different screens, which was a large number for a platform game at the time. For comparison, the Donkey Kong (1981) arcade game had four screens (and its console versions only two or three), which was more typical of the time.
Unlike most of the home computer versions, Miner 2049er for the Atari 8-bit family was released on 16K ROM cartridge with the high price of US$49.95 (equivalent to $133.95 in 2020).
