Titolo: Isolated Warrior

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Isolated Warrior is a 1991 video game developed by KID and published in Japan by Vap, in North America by NTVIC, and Europe by Nintendo. It falls in the shooter genre, although its gameplay also includes elements reminiscent of platforming, while it features isometric projection, similar to Sega's Zaxxon.
Isolated Warrior received mostly positive reception from critics since its initial release; some drew comparison with Zaxxon due to the use of isometric projection, with praise being given to aspects such as the presentation, visuals and frenetic action, but other felt mixed in regards to the sound, difficulty and replay value, while common complaints were geared towards the amount of flickering that occurs when too many objects are present on-screen. Retrospective commentary has been mixed.
