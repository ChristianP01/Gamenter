Titolo: Infamous 2

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Infamous 2 (stylized as inFAMOUS 2) is an action-adventure video game developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3 video game console. It is a sequel to the 2009 video game Infamous. Announced on June 4, 2010, the game was released on June 7, 2011.
The story follows protagonist Cole MacGrath on his quest in New Marais to grow powerful enough to be able to face his nemesis, the Beast. Cole possesses electricity-based superpowers which are used in combat and navigating the city. The player is given several opportunities to use these powers for good or selfish purposes in the game's Karma system. The Karma system affects what powers become available, the reaction of the city's populace towards Cole, and the story.
Development on Infamous 2 began immediately after Sucker Punch finished the first Infamous, led by returning game director Nate Fox. The game's music was composed by James Dooley, Bryan Mantia, the band Galactic, and Jonathan Mayer. Both the game's music and fictional city were inspired by New Orleans. Jason Cottle, the original voice actor for Cole, was replaced by Eric Ladin as Sucker Punch wanted somebody who could perform Cole's physical reactions with motion capture, a new addition to the series.
The game was generally well-received by gaming media upon release. Praise was particularly directed at its city design, traversal, and graphics, though it was criticized for its Karma system and camera. A stand-alone expansion titled Infamous: Festival of Blood was released on October 25, 2011. Infamous Second Son, a sequel for PlayStation 4, was released worldwide on March 21, 2014.
