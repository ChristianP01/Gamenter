Titolo: Forumwarz

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Forumwarz is a multiplayer browser-based role-playing game that is a parody of Internet culture designed by Crotch Zombie Productions, a Toronto-based company run by Robin Ward, Mike Drach, and Jason Kogan. Written in the Ruby on Rails web application framework using the Haml markup language, the game launched on February 7, 2008.  In the first month since the game launched, around 30,000 users signed up.Forumwarz is notable for its humorous and sometimes ribald writing and references to Internet memes. Described as an "internet meta-game", it has been featured in both Wired News and DigitalJournal.com, and was described by Gawker.com as "stupid, insulting, and really damn clever". To ensure new players are aware of the potentially - and deliberately - offensive content of the game, players must confirm that they are "not offended easily" before they can begin playing.  In August 2008, a second episode of the game was in preparation prior to release; it was released in Beta to a small number of players in mid-September. Episode 2 is the continuation of Episode 1. Crotch Zombie released Episode 2 on October 15, 2008. Prior to its release they provided sneak peeks and spoilers of Episode 2 content, while also reaching out to users to provide in-game content. Closed beta began on September 15, inviting contributors of Episode 2 to help test out the content. On January 20, 2010, Forumwarz released its third episode. As of January, 2017 the game had over 250,000 accounts.
