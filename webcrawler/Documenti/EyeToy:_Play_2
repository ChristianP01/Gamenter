Titolo: EyeToy: Play 2

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: EyeToy: Play 2 is the second PlayStation 2 game in the EyeToy: Play series. It uses EyeToy camera technology to project the player on to the television screen, allowing them to interact with on screen objects. The game contains twelve new minigames, that allow for single or multiplayer modes. The game also introduces a tournament mode, that allows several players to compete in a series of minigames, earning points for each game won.
The game also takes advantage of some EyeToy capabilities that the original did not, including being able to detect the speed and force of motion, and increased accuracy. This allows for more depth in games like Baseball, where points can be awarded for more forceful hitting of the ball. In addition, the game features SpyToy, enabling players to turn their EyeToy camera into a security system that will record anyone that passes by. It is possible to capture photos or record video, and record a message that will play on the television screen should anyone come within range. It also contains a demo of EyeToy: AntiGrav in which one races on a hover board.
The game was released in November 2004 in Europe, North America on 16 August 2005 as a bundled package with the EyeToy camera and in June 2005 in Japan.
