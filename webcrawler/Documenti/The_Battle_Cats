Titolo: The Battle Cats

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: The Battle Cats is a free-to-play tower defense game developed by PONOS Corporation for iOS and Android mobile devices, which first emerged in Japan under the name Nyanko Daisensou (Nyanko Great War). The Battle Cats debuted on the Japanese iOS App Store in November 2011 under the name of "Battle Nekos," with Android support following in December of that same year. It has sustained immense popularity in Japan and Korea, with an English version briefly appearing on the English-language iTunes/Google Play stores in 2012. However, it later was deleted in both the US Google Play stores and App Store. An improved version of this game was later released on September 17, 2014. A PC port release was available for download until late 2018, when PONOS Corporation cut support for it.
