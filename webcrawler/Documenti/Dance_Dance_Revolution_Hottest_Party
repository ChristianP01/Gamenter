Descrizione: Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party (ダンスダンスレボリューションホッテストパーティー, Dansu Dansu Reboryūshon Hottesuto Pātī), known as Dancing Stage Hottest Party in the European and Oceanic regions, is a video game released by Konami in 2007 and 2008 to several countries for the Wii console. Konami took the game beyond the traditional setup of Dance Dance Revolution by incorporating the Wii Remote and the standard dance pad into a full body motion game. It has two sequels, Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2 and Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 3.
Unlike the previous release of Dance Dance Revolution on a Nintendo console, Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix, Hottest Party was not a collaboration between Konami and Nintendo. It is not a sequel, but the GameCube accessories for Mario Mix are compatible with Hottest Party.
