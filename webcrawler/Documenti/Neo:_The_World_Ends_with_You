Titolo: Neo: The World Ends with You

Anno: 2021

Descrizione: Neo: The World Ends with You is an action role-playing game co-developed by Square Enix and h.a.n.d. and published by Square Enix. This game is a sequel to the 2007 video game The World Ends with You. It was released for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in July 2021, and for Microsoft Windows in September 2021. The story features a new cast of characters playing the Reapers' Game in Shibuya and, unlike the original game, now features three-dimensional graphics.
Concepts for a sequel to The World Ends with You had been attempted in the years following the original 2007 release, however none came to fruition for one reason or another. Returning staff for the game include Tetsuya Nomura as creative producer and character designer, Gen Kobayashi as character designer, and Hiroyuki Itou, who was game designer in the original but now serves as director. Takeharu Ishimoto, the composer for the original game, though no longer a full time employee of Square Enix, confirmed that he had composed the music for the sequel.
