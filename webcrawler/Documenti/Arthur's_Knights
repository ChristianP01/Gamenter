Descrizione: Arthur's Knights: Tales of Chivalry is an adventure role-playing video game developed by Cryo Interactive and released for Microsoft Windows in October 2000 in North America and November 2000 in Europe. The game's story revolves around the legendary King Arthur in medieval Britain. The player can choose to play the same main character, Bradwen, from either of two perspectives: as a Celt or as a Christian. In both storylines, Bradwen is the illegitimate son of the dying King Cadfanan, leader of the Atrebates tribe shortly following the Roman occupation. Bradwen's goal is to foil the attempts of his evil half-brother Morganor (heir to the throne) at securing a malevolent kingship for himself, through which enactment of his evil intentions will be made possible.
