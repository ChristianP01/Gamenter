Players control Diddy Kong and his friend Dixie Kong, who must rescue Donkey Kong after he is kidnapped by King K. Rool.

It was the second-bestselling game of 1995, the sixth-bestselling game on the SNES, and the highest-selling SNES game that was not packaged with the system.
It was re-released for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) in 2004. The game was made available for download on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007, and the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2015. It was followed by Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! in 1996.
