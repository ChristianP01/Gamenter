Titolo: Lagrange Point (video game)

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Lagrange Point is a role-playing video game developed and published by Konami for the Family Computer. The game was released exclusively in Japan on April 26, 1991. The title of the game references Lagrangian points, the five positions in space where a body of negligible mass could be placed which would then maintain its position relative to two existing massive bodies.
Lagrange Point has the distinction of being one of only two games ever released with Konami's Virtual ROM Controller VII (VRC7) sound generator integrated circuit, which allowed for a drastic improvement in the quality of the music and sound effects used in the game. The game was never localized for western audiences, however an unofficial English translation was released in 2014 by Aeon Genesis.
