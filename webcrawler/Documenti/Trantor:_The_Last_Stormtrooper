Titolo: Trantor: The Last Stormtrooper

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Trantor: The Last Stormtrooper is a video game for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, MSX, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST released by Go! (a label of U.S. Gold) in 1987. A version for MS-DOS was released by KeyPunch Software. It was produced by Probe Software (the team consisted of David Quinn, Nick Bruty and David Perry). It was released in Spain (as "Trantor") by Erbe Software.
The game is a mix between shoot 'em up and a platform game, but it was mostly known for its large and well-animated sprites.  Bruty, who had previously produced graphics within tight limits on other projects, decided instead to focus on artwork and keep other aspects of the game simple to fit the constraints of the platforms.
