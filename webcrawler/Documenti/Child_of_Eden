Titolo: Child of Eden

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Child of Eden is a 2011 musical rail shooter developed by Q Entertainment and published by Ubisoft for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Following the player's journey to purge a far-future internet of viruses, the gameplay features shooting numerous enemies from a first-person perspective, with scores based on performance and bonuses awarded for syncing groups of shots with each stage's musical track. In addition to standard controllers, each version has the option to use motion controls through the Kinect and PlayStation Move respectively. It is a spiritual successor to the 2001 title Rez, carrying over the aim of producing a feeling of synesthesia in players.
The game was conceived by Q Entertainment founder Tetsuya Mizuguchi, and was his last major project with the company. Beginning production in 2008, it carried over Mizuguchi's gameplay philosophies from earlier titles. Motion controls were incorporated after production began. The music and sound production was led by Yuki Ichiki, and featured new and existing music from Genki Rockets, a music group co-created by Mizuguchi. The title met with positive reviews, and saw award nominations. Praise was directed towards its visuals and use of motion controls, while recurring complaints were focused on its short length. Eventually shipping 500,000 copies worldwide, Ubisoft was disappointed in its initial sales.
