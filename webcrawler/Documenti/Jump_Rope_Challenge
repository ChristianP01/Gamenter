Descrizione: Jump Rope Challenge is a fitness video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. In the game, the player is encouraged to "jump a skipping rope", by performing motions using the Joy-Con controllers, every day a prespecified number of times.
The game was developed by a small team to keep active at home during the stay-at-home orders of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released for free on the Switch's Nintendo eShop in June 2020. It was originally intended to be removed from the eShop three months subsequent to release, but Nintendo later announced that the game would remain available until further notice.
