Titolo: Dogyuun

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Dogyuun is a 1992 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and published by Toaplan. Set on the colonized fictional planet of Dino in the future, where an alien race of metallic robots have invaded a police communication center and held its inhabitants as hostages, players assume the role of two fighter pilots taking control of the Sylfers bomber space fighter crafts in an revenge attempt to overthrow the invaders and free the surviving colonists after one of their comrades is killed by one of them during a reconnaissance assignment.
Headed by Tamsoft founder and Battle Arena Toshinden producer Toshiaki ÅŒta, Dogyuun was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan such as Snow Bros. and who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994, putting emphasis on visuals instead of gameplay. The team originally planned on making a mecha title but later settled on doing a vertically scrolling shooter instead after initial testings of the mech game proved to be unsuccessful, while integrating some of their original ideas from the former project into the final release. It is also notable for marking the debut of mangaka and Knuckle Bash designer Junya Inoue in the video game industry, serving as one of its graphic designers.
Dogyuun was praised by reviewers for its visuals, sound design, gameplay, multiplayer, challenge and overall intensity but others felt that some of its mechanics were underdeveloped. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.
