Descrizione: Otaku no Seiza: An Adventure in the Otaku Galaxy (おたくの星座, lit. "Constellation of the Geeks") is a role-playing video game developed by Advance Communications and published by M&M for the Famicom on 1991. Aurora Quest: Otaku no Seiza in Another World (オーロラクエスト おたくの星座) is a remake of the Famicom version for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM by Pack-In-Video on December 1993–which featured updated graphics. Neither version was released outside of Japan. An OVA adaptation of this was also released in Japan on 1994.
