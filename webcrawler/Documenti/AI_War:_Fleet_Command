Titolo: AI War: Fleet Command

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: AI War: Fleet Command is a real time strategy computer game created by independent developer Arcen Games. The game was first released on the Arcen Games website and Impulse on June 2, 2009, before getting a Steam release on October 16, 2009 that coincided with the release of version 2.0. AI War blends the 4X, tower defense, and traditional RTS genre to create something that was hailed as unique but with a steep learning curve. Players go up against two artificial intelligence (AI) opponents that are superior to the player. The objective is to destroy the home planets of both AI opponents.
AI War was lauded by reviewers for being a fresh take on the RTS genre and bringing something new to the table, but criticized for its learning curve and lackluster graphics. It was also noted that the AI represented a significant challenge and reacted to the actions of the player. An expansion titled The Zenith Remnant was released on January 12, 2010 that adds new factions, AI types, ships and new gameplay mechanics.  As of October 27, 2010, a micro-expansion named Children of Neinzul was released, with the sole intention of donating all profits from game sales to Child's Play, a charity for sick children.  Another full expansion was released on January 28, 2011 titled Light of the Spire, which added new content and game modes. On October 19, 2012, AI War 6.0 was released along with the Ancient Shadows expansion. A sequel, AI War 2, was released to early access on Steam on October 15, 2018. The official release was on October 22, 2019.
