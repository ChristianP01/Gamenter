Titolo: Automonopoli

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Automonopoli, also known as Go to Jail, is an unauthorised computer version of the boardgame Monopoly, released in June 1983 by Automata UK for the ZX Spectrum. Although other two-player Monopoly computer programs already existed, the developer advertised that their Automonopoli was the first with an artificial intelligence strong enough to compete against and defeat human players.
Initially released under the name Automonopoli, Waddingtons threatened legal action against Automata, and within weeks of its release the game was rebranded as Go to Jail. Waddingtons, concerned about the potential impact on a forthcoming official Monopoly video game, began formal court proceedings against Automata in late 1983, and the game was withdrawn from sale in early 1984.
