Titolo: Korea: Forgotten Conflict

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Korea: Forgotten Conflict is a real-time strategy, stealth game that takes place in the Korean War. It was developed by Czech studio Plastic Reality Technologies and published by Cenega Publishing.
The game has clanky controls and many bugs, failing to capitalize in the stealth surge of the period. Noticeable features were the movement of characters and the beauty of the scenarios, but this was tainted by awful AI, nonsensical controls and far too many bugs. The playable characters were also heavy-handed stereotypes with repetitive dialog. As tantamount to the title, it remains mostly forgotten today.
