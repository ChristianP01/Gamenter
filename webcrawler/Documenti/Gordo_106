Titolo: Gordo 106

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Gordo 106 is a 1993 platform video game developed by Tenth Planet Software and published by Atari Corporation in North America and Europe exclusively for the Atari Lynx. Set in the installations of N. Human Laboratories, players assume the role of an exploited laboratory monkey named Gordo, who unintentionally gained intelligence as a result of experimentation with radiation in order to free other animal test subjects and escape from the building, while defeating scientists and employees of the complex along the way. Its gameplay consists of platforming and exploration with a main three-button configuration.
Conceived by FM Waves co-founder Efraim Wyeth before being rebranded as Tenth Planet, Gordo 106 began development in 1991 and was jointly created by David Brevik and the brothers Erich and Max Schaefer, who would later go on to establish Condor before being now known as Blizzard North. Wyeth originally had no set direction for their first title but after meeting with Jack Tramiel in a reunion, he proposed several projects before settling with one that would become the basis of the project, which took influence from Spider-Man.
Since its release, Gordo 106 has received very mixed reception from critics and reviewers alike who criticized its low framerate, overall visuals, audio, controls and gameplay, though some praised the parallax scrolling. A remake for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was in development by Atomic Games and planned to be published by DTMC but it was never released.
