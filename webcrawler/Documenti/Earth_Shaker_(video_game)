Titolo: Earth Shaker (video game)

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Earth Shaker is a Boulder Dash-inspired game published as a cover tape in 1990 in Your Sinclair (for the ZX Spectrum 48k). Notable in being the first covertape to subjectively set a high standard, having been initially rejected by publishers Zeppelin because of First Star's suing of companies publishing Boulder Dash clones.
