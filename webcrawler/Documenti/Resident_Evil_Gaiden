Titolo: Resident Evil Gaiden

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Resident Evil Gaiden is an action-adventure game for the Game Boy Color developed by Capcom and M4, and first released on December 14, 2001. Receiving generally mixed reviews by critics, the game marks a departure from other entries in the series, insofar as areas are explored with the playable character seen from a top-down perspective and with battles fought in first-person view. The story revolves around a viral outbreak on a passenger ship and has Leon S. Kennedy and Barry Burton return as protagonists. This game is non-canon, as its plot is contradicted by the main series in key parts, and its events are ignored.
