Descrizione: Primal Carnage: Extinction is an asymmetrical multiplayer game released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4. It features human versus dinosaur combat. Players choose which team to play on, and each team has a set of characters divided into classes. The game is an update and sequel to the 2012 Windows game Primal Carnage, which was developed by Lukewarm Media.

However, Circle 5 Studios took over development from Lukewarm Media, and announced that the update would instead be released as a separate game known as Primal Carnage: Extinction, co-developed by Pub Games. It was released for Windows on April 3, 2015. The PlayStation 4 version, developed by Panic Button, was released on October 20, 2015.
