The team was inspired by other team-based shooters with colorful visuals such as Team Fortress 2. They faced different challenges when designing the game's eight classes. The game is powered by the Frostbite 3 engine, and the team collaborated closely with Frostbite's developer EA DICE when implementing its technology.
The game was revealed at E3 2013, and released in February 2014 as a budget title for Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 releases followed. The game received a generally positive reception from critics, with praise directed at its playful tone, art, combat, and character designs.

By November 2015, more than eight million players had played the game. A sequel, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 was released in February 2016.
