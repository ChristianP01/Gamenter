Titolo: Puyo Puyo~n

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Puyo Puyo~n (ぷよぷよ〜ん, Puyopuyōn), also known as Puyo Puyo 4, and Puyo Puyo~n Party (for the N64 version) is the fourth installment of the Puyo Puyo puzzle game series, created by Compile for the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color. Like many of the Puyo Puyo games, it was never officially released outside Japan. The title of Puyo Puyo~n comes from the Japanese word yon (四, meaning four), signifying the fourth game in the series. Plans were made for a 64DD version entitled Puyo Puyo~n 64 (ぷよぷよ〜ん64, Puyopuyōn rokujushi), but it was later cancelled for the N64 release.
