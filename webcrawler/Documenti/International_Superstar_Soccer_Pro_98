Descrizione: International Superstar Soccer Pro 98 (officially abbreviated as ISS Pro 98, sometimes called International Superstar Soccer '98, and released in Japan in three editions: J.League Jikkyō Winning Eleven 3 (Jリーグ実況ウイニングイレブン３, J Rīgu Jikkyō Wingu Irebun 3), World Soccer Jikkyō Winning Eleven 3: World Cup France '98 (ワールドサッカー 実況ウイニングイレブン3 〜ワールドカップ フランス'98〜, Wārudo Sakkā Jikkyō Wingu Irebun 3 〜Wārudo Kappu Furansu '98〜) and World Soccer Jikkyō Winning Eleven 3 Final Ver. (ワールドサッカー 実況ウイニングイレブン3 〜Final Ver.〜, Wārudo Sakkā Jikkyō Wingu Irebun 3 〜Final Ver.〜)) is a football video game which follows International Superstar Soccer Pro developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The Japanese version was re-released in late 1998 as Winning Eleven 3: Final Version with some slight improvements. The English commentary for the game is provided by Tony Gubba.
Although it lacked FIFPro licence, the European releases featured Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli along with German goalkeeper Andreas Koepke (on German, French and Spanish releases) or English midfielder Paul Ince (on British and Italian releases) on the cover, and the North American release featured Colombian player Carlos Valderrama. The game shares the same cover arts with the Nintendo 64 game International Superstar Soccer 98 but they are individual iterations of different game franchises, only released with similar name. This is a characteristic also shared with the previous game, ISS Pro.
