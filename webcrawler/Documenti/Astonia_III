Descrizione: Astonia III was a fantasy MMORPG video game that was initially released in September 2001. It was developed as a solo project by German programmer Daniel Brockhaus as a sequel to his earlier project, a smaller MMORPG called Mercenaries of Astonia. At the end of the year, Astonia III launched into a full release, and started to charge players a monthly subscription fee, with one month free trial. In late 2014, the game's official servers were shut down, and its source code was released online by Brockhaus.
