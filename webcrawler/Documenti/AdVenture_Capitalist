Descrizione: AdVenture Capitalist is a free-to-play incremental video game developed and published by Hyper Hippo Productions. It was first released for browsers and Android in 2014, for iOS (published by Kongregate), Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in 2015, and for PlayStation 4 in 2016. AdVenture Capitalist allows players to live like a capitalist and invest funds into certain products to generate revenue, by starting out with a single lemonade stand. The more revenue generated, the higher the player's cash is. A player can receive an angel bonus when resetting their progress, which provides a boost in all products' revenue for the next progress timeline. New areas of business have been added since the game's release, allowing the purchase of property on the Moon and Mars. A spin-off, AdVenture Communist, was released on Steam as early access on August 10, 2016, with the completed game being released on iOS and Android on November 16, 2017.
