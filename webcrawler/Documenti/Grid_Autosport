Descrizione: Grid Autosport is a racing video game developed by Codemasters for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Linux, iOS, macOS, Nintendo Switch and Android. It is the ninth game in the TOCA series. It aims to move the series back towards "more authentic racing games" following the release of Grid 2, which Codemasters felt was not as well-received by the company's core fanbase as it was hoped for. The developers consequently introduced major modifications to the handling model and built a lean, race-first oriented design for this title.Many critics who praised the game cited how Codemasters seemed to have "gone back to its roots", with aspects from its early games in the series.Feral Interactive, who brought the game to macOS and Linux, also brought the game to iOS on 27 November 2017. The Nintendo Switch version, also from Feral Interactive, was released on 19 September 2019, and their Android version of the game was released on 26 November.A sequel, Grid, was released on in October 2019 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.
