Descrizione: Landmaker (ランドメーカー) is an arcade puzzle video game developed and released by Taito in 1998. It is a versus action puzzle game similar in appearance to Taito's own Puzzle Bobble, though it plays more like Puyo Puyo or Baku Baku Animal. The arcade version was released only in Japan, though a prototype for a worldwide release exists.
The game was ported to the PlayStation in 1999, featuring a completely new set of modes using 3D graphics. This version was later released in North America by Jaleco as Builder's Block, and then in Europe by Eon Digital Entertainment. More recently, this version was distributed through the PlayStation Network in Japan by Square Enix.
