Descrizione: Low G Man: The Low Gravity Man is a 1990 action-platform video game developed by KID and published by Taxan in North America and by Nintendo in Europe for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
Low G Man was met with mixed reception from critics since its initial release; many felt divided in regards to the graphics, sound and gameplay, while common complaints were geared towards the jerky background scrolling, choppy animations, small character sprites and color scheme but praise was given to the fast-paced soundtrack and large bosses. Retrospective commentary has been mostly positive.
