Descrizione: Houkago no Love Beat (放課後のLove Beat, After School Love Beat) is a Japanese-only PlayStation 2 otome game (also referred to as GxB games) released on June 10, 2004.  A notable feature of the game is the integration of real J-pop songs into the gameplay, and the ability to watch and listen to the songs again once you have mastered them in-game, as well as the fact that the main character has a voice (many otome games' main characters are not voice acted). The publisher classifies it as a 'love adventure' (恋愛アドベンチャー, Renai Adobenchā) game.
