Titolo: Creatures (1990 video game)

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Creatures is a platform game for the Commodore 64 computer, released in 1990.  It was developed by Apex Computer Productions, the company started by two brothers, John Rowlands (who wrote the code) and Steve Rowlands (who created the graphics and music). Atari ST conversion made by WJS Design were released in 1992 and Amiga in 1993.
The backronym "Clyde Radcliffe Exterminates All The Unfriendly Repulsive Earth-ridden Slime" is used as a subtitle to the game.
The game was followed by Creatures II: Torture Trouble in 1992.
Creatures relied on 'cutesy' graphics interspersed with very bloody 'torture screens' where between each level a single screen puzzle was presented to the player, who had to solve it (often in a highly humorous fashion) or run out of time and lose the game, together with a very bloody end for the recipient of the torture.
