Titolo: Half-Life 2

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Half-Life 2 is a first-person shooter game developed by Valve. It is the sequel to the 1998 game Half-Life, as well as the second game in the Half-Life series. Like its predecessor, the game combines shooting, puzzles and storytelling, and adds features such as vehicles and physics-based gameplay. Set roughly twenty years after the events of the first game, Half-Life 2 follows Gordon Freeman as he joins a resistance movement to liberate the Earth from the control of an alien empire called the Combine.
The game was created using Valve's Source engine, which was developed at the same time. Development lasted five years and cost US$40 million. Valve president Gabe Newell set his team the goal of redefining the first-person shooter genre, focusing on advanced physics systems and non-player characters. Valve announced Half-Life 2 at E3 2003 and released it through its new distribution service Steam after delaying it by over a year. A year before release, an unfinished version of the game was stolen by a hacker and leaked online.
Half-Life 2 was released on November 16, 2004, and received acclaim for its advanced physics, animation, sound, AI, graphics, and narrative. It won 39 Game of the Year awards, and has been cited as one of the best games of all time. By 2011, it had sold 12 million copies. Half-Life 2 was followed by the free extra level Lost Coast (2005) and the episodic sequels Episode One (2006) and Episode Two (2007). In 2020, after canceling several further Half-Life projects, Valve released the prequel Half-Life: Alyx.
