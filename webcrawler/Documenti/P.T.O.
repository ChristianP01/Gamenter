Descrizione: P.T.O. (Pacific Theater of Operations), released as Teitoku no Ketsudan (提督の決断) in Japan, is a console strategy video game released by Koei. It was originally released for the PC-9801 in 1989 and had been ported to various platforms, such as the X68000, FM Towns, PC-8801 (1990), MSX2 (1991), Sega Genesis and the Super NES (all three in 1992). Players could assume one side of the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II, acting as naval commander, organizing fleets, building new ships, appropriating supplies and fuel, and even engaging in diplomacy with other countries. The player can choose one of several World War Two battles to simulate, or could control the entire Pacific campaign well before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
A sequel, P.T.O. II, was released by Koei in 1993. Teitoku no Ketsudan III was never released outside Japan, but a P.T.O. IV was released for the PlayStation 2 in the US and Europe.
