Titolo: Neopets

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Neopets is a virtual pet website. Users can own virtual pets ("Neopets"), and buy virtual items for them using one of two virtual currencies. One currency, called Neopoints, can be earned within the site, and the other, Neocash, can either be purchased with real-world money, or won by chance in-game.
The website was launched by Adam Powell and Donna Williams in late 1999. Two years later, a consortium of investors led by Doug Dohring bought a controlling interest in the company and in June 2005, Viacom (the company that owns Nickelodeon) bought Neopets Inc. for US$160 million. On 17 March 2014, Viacom and Nickelodeon sold Neopets to JumpStart Games for an undisclosed amount. On 3 July 2017, Chinese company NetDragon acquired JumpStart.
