Titolo: Dead Island: Riptide

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Dead Island: Riptide is a survival horror video game and sequel to Dead Island developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver, released in April 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Riptide serves as a continuation of the story to 2011's Dead Island, with the original four survivors, plus a new survivor, arriving on another island in the Banoi archipelago, which has also been overrun by zombies.
Dead Island: Riptide received a mixed reception from critics, who cited that the game did not fix any of its predecessor's problems, nor add anything new to the gameplay. A third title and first official sequel for the series, Dead Island 2, was revealed at E3 2014. It was originally set for a 2016 release; however, since Sumo Digital took over development in March 2016, a specific release date has not yet been announced. Along with the first game, Riptide was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and SteamOS under the title Dead Island: Definitive Edition.
