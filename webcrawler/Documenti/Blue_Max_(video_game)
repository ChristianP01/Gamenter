Descrizione: Blue Max is a scrolling shooter written by Bob Polin for the Atari 8-bit family and published by Synapse Software in 1983. It was released for the Commodore 64 the same year, followed by a U.S. Gold port for the ZX Spectrum in 1987. Atari Corporation published Blue Max in cartridge form for the then-new Atari XEGS. The player controls a Sopwith Camel biplane during World War I, attempting to shoot down enemy planes and bomb targets on diagonally scrolling terrain. The game is named after the medal Pour le MÃ©rite, informally known as Blue Max. Its theme song is "Rule, Britannia!".
In 1984, Synapse released a sequel, Blue Max 2001. While the original was well received, the sequel was considered disappointing.
