Titolo: Ninja Gaiden (arcade game)

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Ninja Gaiden, released in Japan as Ninja Ryūkenden (忍者龍剣伝, lit. Ninja Dragon Sword Legend) and in Europe as Shadow Warriors, is a 1988 side-scrolling beat-'em-up game, originally released by Tecmo as a coin-operated arcade video game.  It was first released in North America and Europe in late 1988, and then in Japan in February 1989. The Ninja Gaiden arcade game was produced and released almost simultaneously with its home console counterpart for the Nintendo Entertainment System, although they are different games with only a few similarities. The designer of the arcade game is only credited as "Strong Shima", but Masato Kato, who worked on the NES version, identified him as one "Mr. Iijima". It was the first game released in the Ninja Gaiden franchise. The arcade game was a major commercial success in North America, becoming the highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1989 in the United States.
Home versions of the Ninja Gaiden arcade game were released in Europe under the Shadow Warriors title in 1990 by Ocean Software for five different computer platforms (Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC), in North America for IBM PC by Hi-Tech Expressions, and as a single-player game for the Atari Lynx console by BlueSky Software. The arcade version of Ninja Gaiden is also included as a hidden bonus game in Ninja Gaiden Black for the Xbox in 2005. The arcade game was published as a Virtual Console game for the Nintendo Wii in 2009, and also as an Arcade Archive game for the Nintendo Switch on May 9, 2019.
