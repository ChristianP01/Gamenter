Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Kid≈ç Senshi Z Gundam: Hot Scramble, known outside Japan as Mobile Suit Z Gundam: Hot Scramble, is a 1986 rail shooter video game developed by Game Studio and published by Bandai for the Family Computer (also known as Famicom in Japan and Nintendo Entertainment System internationally). It is based on the anime Mobile Suit Z Gundam, and is one of the first Gundam video games.
The game sold over 400,000 copies, helping to launch the Gundam video game franchise. Aside from the much later Famicom Mini release, there were two versions of the game: the original release; and a special release of the central location test version, sometimes dubbed Final Version. Only 1,000 copies of this second version were ever released, making it among the rarest video games in history.
