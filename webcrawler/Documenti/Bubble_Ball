On January 8, 2011, Corona Labs (formerly Ansca Mobile), the company which makes the software development kit that Nay used, chose Bubble Ball as its app of the week  and it has since surpassed 16 million downloads, and at one point displaced Angry Birds from its number one spot on the list of free games in Apple app store.Bubble Ball is a 156-level puzzle game with puzzles ranging from very simple to really challenging. On each level you are given a range of tools and pieces before you hit the Start button. In addition to planks and ramps that can be created with a set of geometric pieces, there are catapults, accelerators and gravity inverters, which must be carefully positioned to make sure your ball gets to the finish goal. This game is number three on "Ansca mobile's Hall of Fame."
As of January 19, 2011, Bubble Ball had been downloaded more than two million times. Current versions of the application can be downloaded from the Apple App Store and Google Play for free.
