Titolo: IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover is a World War II combat flight simulator released in 2011. It was originally developed by the Russian software house 1C:Maddox Games but since 2012 it is under development by Team Fusion Simulations. In 2017 that latter released an improved version of the game under the name IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover - Blitz which started the so called Dover series. The basic Blitz game represents the Battle of Britain during the Summer of 1940 while an add-on released in 2020 represents the air combats during the Western Desert campaign in North Africa in the period of 1940-1943. A second add-on, thus introducing in the game a third theatre of operations, is in the works, but no release date has been announced yet.The game inherits the name IL-2 Sturmovik from the IL-2 Sturmovik classical simulator (originally released in 2001) and is considered as the second generation in the IL-2 Sturmovik series because it runs its own game engine instead of sharing it with the two other generations.
To be run, same as the original game back in 2011, the 2017 Blitz rerelease requires the Steam service.
