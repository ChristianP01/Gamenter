Titolo: Earth Eternal

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Earth Eternal was a graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing game initially developed by American studio Sparkplay Media, and then re-published by Sankando. First announced on January 10, 2007, it was released for Open Beta on Oct. 7, 2009. It was free to play with additional pay for bonuses. On August 8, 2010, SparkPlay Media announced it was likely going into bankruptcy and that it was actively holding an auction for Earth Eternal. The credit system was shut down and many of its items were made freely available. SparkPlay Media's CEO stated that unless a buyer was forthcoming, Earth Eternal would end when its webhost shut down the server for non-payment. However, on August 18, 2010, Earth Eternal was bought off in an auction. On August 31, 2010, the plug was pulled on the Earth Eternal website and game for lack of payment. It would appear that Earth Eternal has been bought by Japanese online game company Sankando. On July 21, 2011, the Earth Eternal website was reopened and the game was scheduled to be released in North America in Summer 2011. As of November 24, 2011 at 9 PM EST, the game and website once again went offline for an indefinite period of time.
