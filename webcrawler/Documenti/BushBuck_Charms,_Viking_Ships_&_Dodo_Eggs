Descrizione: Bushbuck Charms, Viking Ships & Dodo Eggs, also known as Bush Buck: Global Treasure Hunter, is an educational computer game released in 1991.  Designed by the Australian company Reckon, the game was published by "PC Globe", a small US-based company that specialized in "edutainment" software in the late 1980s and early 90s.  In the tradition of Br√∏derbund's Carmen Sandiego games, "Bushbuck Charms, Viking Ships and Dodo Eggs" taught geography through a storyline that involved a global scavenger hunt for unusual items.  Each game, the player had to find fifteen items which the game chose from a selection of hundreds of possible items.  A few of the possible items were a hemlock leaf, a lava-lava, and an alpaca poncho.  The game ran on the Amiga and MS-DOS platforms.
