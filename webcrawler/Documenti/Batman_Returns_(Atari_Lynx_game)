Titolo: Batman Returns (Atari Lynx game)

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Batman Returns is a 1992 side-scrolling action-beat 'em up video game developed and published by Atari Corporation in North America and Europe for the Atari Lynx. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is inspired by the Warner Bros.'s 1992 film of the same name. In the main storyline, Batman must confront both Catwoman and the Penguin.
Headed by Checkered Flag producer John Skruch, Batman Returns on the Atari Lynx was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Atari Corp. for their platform. The team undertook the Lynx version in 1991 but a tight development cycle and multiple issues were faced during the creation process before its eventual launch to the market, which were attributed to the film's production schedule. The game was met with mixed reception from critics; common complaints were towards the high level of difficulty, steep learning curve and repetitive gameplay, although it was praised for its presentation, detailed graphics and sound design. The title later became a pack-in game for the Lynx II in certain regions.
