Descrizione: MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat is a vehicle simulation game developed and published by Activision, released in 1995 as part of the MechWarrior series of video games in the BattleTech franchise. The game is set in 3057, and is played as a tactical simulation that incorporates aspects of real-time first-person combat and the physical simulation of the player's mech. It is a game recreation of the "Refusal War." The player can join one of the clans, Clan Jade Falcon or Clan Wolf while engaging in up to 32 missions.
The game was originally developed for MS-DOS and was ported to other platforms including Windows, Macintosh, and the game consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation (as MechWarrior 2: Arcade Combat Edition). The MS-DOS, Windows, and Mac releases share the same gameplay while the console versions tweaked the game's mechanics to emphasize arcade-style action over the tactical-simulation of the original PC release. Several enhanced versions were released to take advantage of the 3D graphics accelerator cards that were available at the time. The game has a rendered introduction sequence produced by Digital Domain and its soundtrack was composed by Jeehun Hwang.
MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat received a follow-up expansion pack called MechWarrior 2: Ghost Bear's Legacy and a stand-alone expansion titled MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries. MechWarror 2 was critically well-received and its sales exceeded 500,000 copies within three months of its release.
