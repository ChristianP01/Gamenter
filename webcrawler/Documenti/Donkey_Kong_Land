Titolo: Donkey Kong Land

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Donkey Kong Land is a platform game for the Game Boy developed by Rare and published by Nintendo in June 1995. The game is the handheld sequel of Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), which spawned its own series alongside the SNES series. Donkey Kong Land was enhanced for the Super Game Boy and featured a "banana yellow" cartridge, which was later used for its sequels. Many of the game's background elements, character models, and sound effects retained the same style as those in Donkey Kong Country. Despite sharing common level themes, the level design and story in DKL are different.
The game was re-released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in 2014.
