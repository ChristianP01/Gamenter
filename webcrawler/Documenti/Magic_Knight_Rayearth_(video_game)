Titolo: Magic Knight Rayearth (video game)

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Magic Knight Rayearth is a Japanese video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn in 1995. It is an action role-playing video game based on the manga and anime series of the same title (Magic Knight Rayearth). Though one of the first games for the Saturn, it became the last Saturn game released in North America, chiefly due to its prolonged internationalization and localization. The game was released in North America by Working Designs in November 1998.The game focuses on three characters who travel the world of Cephiro to rescue an abducted princess named Emerald.
At least five other video games based on the anime series have been released: two for the Game Boy (the second one with the title Mahou Kishi Rayearth 2nd: The Missing Colors), one for the Super Famicom, and two for the Sega Game Gear (the second game subtitled "Making of Magic Knight"). All six are completely different games, not ports.
