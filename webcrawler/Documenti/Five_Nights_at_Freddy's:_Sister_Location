Descrizione: Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location is a point-and-click survival horror video game created by Scott Cawthon. It is the fifth main installment of the Five Nights at Freddy's series.

The game differs in several ways from previous Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s installments.

Throughout the game, the player interacts with a new cast of animatronic characters, central to which is a child-like animatronic named Circus Baby.
The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the story and voice performances, but criticised some aspects of its gameplay. A sequel, Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator, was released on December 4, 2017.
