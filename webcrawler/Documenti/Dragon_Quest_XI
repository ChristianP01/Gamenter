Titolo: Dragon Quest XI

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix. An entry in the long-running Dragon Quest video game series, it was released in Japan for the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation 4 in July 2017 and worldwide for the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows in September 2018. An enhanced version, Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age - Definitive Edition, was released for Nintendo Switch in September 2019; for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in December 2020; and for Stadia in March 2021.
One of the first games announced for the Switch, the game was originally conceived to be fully open world, but the idea was discarded when it conflicted with the story the developers wanted to tell. To increase the awareness of the Dragon Quest franchise in the west, support for Microsoft Windows and features such as voiced English dialogue and 4K resolution were included. Elements added later included an expanded plot and an option to listen to an orchestral version of the score.
Upon release, the game was well received by critics. It received acclaim for its story, characters, narrative, and localization. However, some critics felt that the game was overly traditional in its design. The game shipped over six million copies by September 2020. The game's protagonist, the Luminary, has also been featured in crossover media such as Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
