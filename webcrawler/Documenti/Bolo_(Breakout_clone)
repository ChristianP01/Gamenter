Titolo: Bolo (Breakout clone)

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Bolo is a 1987 Breakout clone written for the Atari ST using the high resolution monochrome monitor. It was later remade for Macintosh and MS-DOS. Bolo was written by Meinolf Schneider, better remembered for his Oxyd games.
Bolo is in the same vein as Taito's Arkanoid, including numerous additions such as gravity, exploding bricks, and tunneling to make the game more interesting and challenging. Bolo was popular with Atari ST users in Germany at the time.
