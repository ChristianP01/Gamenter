Titolo: Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is a turn-based strategy adventure game developed by Ubisoft Milan and published by Ubisoft for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a crossover between Nintendo's Mario and Ubisoft's Raving Rabbids franchises and features both single player and multiplayer gameplay. The story sees the player controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom.
The game, developed by Ubisoft's Milan division, was conceived in 2014 by the studio's creative director Davide Soliani and Ubisoft brand producer Xavier Manzanares. The goals of the development team were to emphasize the dissonance in the two franchises, as well as to create a strategy game that stood out with unique elements. Visuals and animation were made casual and vibrant, and music was composed by Grant Kirkhope. Although the game was met with poor reception when leaked prior to the announcement, it was revered at the official revealing at E3 2017.
Critical reception was overall positive, with absolute acclaim towards its unique and simplistic combat, with mixed reviews of the game's puzzles and blend of Rabbids's humor. While most critics were doubtful of the franchise blend, they ultimately acknowledged that the game had a dissonant nature but was a high-quality experience. An expansion pack, subtitled Donkey Kong Adventure, was released as downloadable content in 2018 while a sequel, Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, is planned for release in 2022.
