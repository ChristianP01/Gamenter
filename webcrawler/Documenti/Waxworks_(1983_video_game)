Descrizione: Waxworks is an interactive fiction game by Brian Howarth and Cliff J. Ogden. It was published by Digital Fantasia in 1983 for the Commodore 64, Plus/4, ZX Spectrum, and BBC Micro.  It was the 11th game in the Mysterious Adventures series.The story is about a waxworks in which the protagonist is trapped. Escaping involves finding statues of famous people (like Hillary and Tenzing).
Whilst some of the statues are exceptionally easy to identify, others are not so simple without acquiring the necessary clues earlier in the game. For example, identifying the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George is exceptionally problematic without first finding a clue to his whereabouts.
