Titolo: Darkfall

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Darkfall was a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Aventurine SA that combined real-time action and strategy in a fantasy setting. The game featured unrestricted PvP, full looting, a large, dynamic game world, and a player-skill dependent combat system free of the class and level systems that typify most MMORPGs. Darkfall had a 3D world environment and contained mild violence.
The official Darkfall servers were closed on 15 November 2012.
Aventurine has since sold the license of Darkfall Online to two independent companies, Ub3rgames and Big Picture Games.
