Titolo: Geograph Seal

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Geograph Seal is a first-person mecha platform-shooter video game developed and published by Exact exclusively for the Sharp X68000 in Japan on March 12, 1994. The fourth and last title to be created and released by Exact for the X68000 platform late into its commercial life span, after being discontinued in 1993 by Sharp Corporation with the last model launched, it is widely considered a spiritual predecessor to the Jumping Flash! franchise by Sony Computer Entertainment.Taking place in a futuristic sci-fi setting on the fictional planet WS090, players assume the role of a pilot controlling a bi-pedal animal-like mech on an attempt to execute the titular project by fighting against the oppressive enemy robots from the surface of the planet and obliterating the planetary core in order to destroy the infested planet entirely.
Geograph Seal garnered mostly positive reception from critics who praised multiple aspects such as the presentation, graphics, sound design, controls and gameplay, becoming yet another popular title among the X68000 userbase from Exact and eventually being named "Game of the Year" by Japanese magazine Oh!X. Shortly after its late release on the computer, Exact would go on to develop a three-dimensional platform tech demo for the PlayStation that would later become into the first Jumping Flash! entry.
