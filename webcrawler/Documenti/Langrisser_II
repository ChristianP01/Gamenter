Titolo: Langrisser II

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Langrisser II is a tactical role-playing game for the Sega Mega Drive console. It is the sequel to Warsong, and was never released outside Japan. Langrisser II was also remade for the Super Famicom by Masaya as Der Langrisser, which featured multiple paths through the game, greatly reduced difficulty, and reworked graphics. A PC-FX port, Der Langrisser FX, was also released, featuring animated cutscenes. It was later compiled with the first Langrisser for the PlayStation as Langrisser I&II, and then given a script edit and new branch of the Imperial path in its final Saturn remake as Langrisser: Dramatic Edition. A Windows 98 release of the game was released in Japanese, Chinese and Korean; it features redrawn, high-resolution graphics, but a vastly trimmed-down soundtrack to fit the confines of a standard length CD. A full remake of Langrisser I&II was also released in 2019 on both Sony PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, featuring highly rendered graphics and BGM.
