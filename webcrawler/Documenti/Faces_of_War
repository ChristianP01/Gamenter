Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Faces of War (originally known as Outfront II, Russian: В тылу врага 2, or Behind Enemy Lines 2) is a real-time strategy and real-time tactics war video game developed by Ukrainian developer Best Way and published by Russian publisher 1C Company. The game is a sequel to 2004's Soldiers: Heroes of World War II.

The developers have also improved the multiplayer options from the last game, with many more modes and options. The game was released in Russia on September 8, 2006 and North America for PC on September 12, 2006.
Game scenario writers include Alexander Zorich.
