Like its predecessor, NBA Street V3 focuses on the streetball variation of basketball, featuring 3-on-3 matches and dunk contests. Players are able to perform over-the-top trick moves in order to get past opposing players and gain points in order to earn a Gamebreaker, a shot or dunk that gifts the player extra points and removes a point from the opposing team. The main Street Challenge mode allows players to create their own player in the game, along with their own streetball court, build up reputation, defeat rival teams, and win various dunk contests and tournaments. The game features all 30 NBA teams along with five players from each team, as well as numerous NBA legends, such as Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.
