It was the first game released by Wispfire, a Dutch indie studio located in the Dutch Game Garden, Utrecht.

On March 31, 2017, Wispfire released a Patch that allows Herald to be played on Xbox 360, Xbox One and the Sony Dualshock 4 for PlayStation 4.As a mix of between an adventure game and a visual novel, Herald is a choice-driven adventure game with a branching narrative, where the player can choose how the main protagonist, Devan Rensburg, behaves and interacts with other characters, thus affecting the storyline.
Herald is episodic, with Book I and II were released on February 22, 2017, for Steam, GOG, Humble, and itch.io Stores. Book III and IV will tell the rest of Devan's voyage on the HLV Herald and is already in pre-production and is scheduled to be released at a later date.
On February 6, 2015, while still in development, Herald won the "Indie Prize Showcase for Best Narrative" and nominated for "Best Art" at Casual Connect, Amsterdam.Due to its theme on colonialism and other social and political issues, VALUE, a research group that studies the intersections of archaeology and video games, includes a chapter written by Roy van der Schilden and Bart Heijltjes about Herald and how Wispfire used history to create the game in their original book The Interactive Past.
