Titolo: Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures is a 3D platform video game based on the Cartoon Network animated television series Ed, Edd n Eddy, developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and Cartoon Network Interactive and published by Midway Games. The game's plot is loosely structured around six different stories with two bonus levels, each involving a scam by the titular trio to acquire enough money to buy jawbreakers, a plot that mirrors that of the animated series. Players may choose at any point to take control of Ed, Edd, or Eddy to overcome the game's obstacles. Character selection is strategical due to each of the Eds having his own unique ability. Throughout the game, the player encounters not only the Ed trio but also the series' side characters, such as Jimmy, Sarah, Kevin, Jonny, and the Kanker sisters.
It was announced on February 15, 2005, and released on November 3, 2005, for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and Microsoft Windows.
