Titolo: Myst

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Myst is a graphic adventure puzzle video game designed by the Miller brothers, Robyn and Rand. It was developed by Cyan, Inc., published by Broderbund, and initially released for the Macintosh personal computer platform in 1993. In the game, players travel via a special book to the island of Myst. There, players solve puzzles, and by doing so, travel to four other worlds, known as Ages, which reveal the backstory of the game's characters.
The Miller brothers got their start in video game development by creating titles for children. They conceived Myst as their first game for adults, receiving funding from publisher Sunsoft. Development began in 1991 and was Cyan's biggest undertaking to date. Technical constraints of the time influenced the design of the game and the production of its graphics, which were state-of-the-art but static. Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music that became the soundtrack to Myst.
Myst was a surprise hit. Critics lauded the ability of the game to immerse players in its fictional world. Selling more than six million copies, Myst became the best-selling PC game until The Sims exceeded Myst sales in 2002. Myst helped drive adoption of the new CD-ROM format, spawned a multimedia franchise, and inspired clones, parodies, and new genres of video games. Multiple remakes and ports of the game to other platforms have been released, as well as spin-off novels and other media.
