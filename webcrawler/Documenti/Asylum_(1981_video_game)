Titolo: Asylum (1981 video game)

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Asylum is an adventure game created by William F. Denman Jr. and released in 1981 by Med Systems (later known as Screenplay) of Chapel Hill, North Carolina for the TRS-80 computer. It combines a text adventure with simple line graphics to create a first-person perspective 3D game. Med Systems had earlier released games like Rat's Revenge, Deathmaze 5000, and Labyrinth with the same kind of graphics; these games were among the earliest commercial examples of 3D games.
A sequel named Asylum II was released in 1982. The sequel was later enhanced with bitmapped graphics, color, and improved descriptions, and released simply as Asylum in for the Atari 8-bit family in 1983, and Commodore 64 and IBM PC in 1985.
