Titolo: EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: EcoQuest: The Search for Cetus is an educational adventure game developed by Sierra On-Line. The original concept was developed by Sierra VP of Creative Development, Bill Davis. The game designers are Jane Jensen and Gano Haine. The game was going to be ported to Amiga and Macintosh, but those releases never came out. A sequel, Lost Secret of the Rainforest, was released in 1993.
The last of Sierra's various Quest series, EcoQuest is designed to teach about the importance of environmental ethics. The games are considerably easier than most Sierra adventures and cannot be lost or rendered unwinnable. Both use a fully mouse-driven version of SCI1, in the manner of Space Quest IV and King's Quest VI. The Search for Cetus was released first on floppy disk, then on CD-ROM with full speech in 1992.
