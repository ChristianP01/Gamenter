Titolo: Galapagos (video game)

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Galapagos: Mendel's Escape is a computer action game developed by Anark Game Studios and published by Electronic Arts in 1997. It is perhaps best known for its use of "artificial life technology" to control the main character, only giving the player indirect control of the creature by manipulating the environment. Because of this, Galapagos has been called the first commercial video game to use artificial life methodology, though it was beaten to the market by Creatures, whose development cycle overlapped with that of Galapagos.
