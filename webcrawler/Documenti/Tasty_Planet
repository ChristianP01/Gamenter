Descrizione: Tasty Planet is a widely distributed and diverse franchise of top-down video games published by Vancouver-based studio Dingo Games. The games are targeted at ages 8 years and older, and may be downloaded to Windows or Macintosh systems.The games are focused on the evolution of a prototype bathroom cleaner, "Grey Goo". The levels follow the Grey Goo as it advances from eating dirt particles to bugs and leaves, and then eventually the rest of the universe. The game is arcade in style and has both a casual mode, where players can play for leisure without a timer and the full game which is timed and must be completed before the time runs out to complete the level. In the original Tasty Planet game, there are also 3 bonus levels called Endurance levels, which are long, and can take up to an hour to complete each. The iOS and Android Tasty Planet games only have the normal mode, and it doesn't have a time limit.
