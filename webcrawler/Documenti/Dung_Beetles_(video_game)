Titolo: Dung Beetles (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Dung Beetles is an Apple II maze game by Bob Bishop published in 1982 by Datasoft. The gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, but a portion of the maze around the player-controlled character is enlarged as if being viewed through a square magnifying lens.
Dung Beetles was ported to Atari 8-bit family and the TRS-80 Color Computer. The Color Computer version was sold by Tandy and renamed Mega-Bug. The Mega-Bug port was programmed by Steve Bjork. Later versions for both the Apple II and Atari were named Tumble Bugs. In 1983, Datasoft moved the game to its Gentry Software label with another name change: Magneto Bugs. In Australia, the game was sold as Bug Attack. It was also released for the NEC PC-6001.
