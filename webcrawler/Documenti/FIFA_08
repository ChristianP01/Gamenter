Titolo: FIFA 08

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: FIFA 08 (titled FIFA Soccer 08 in North America) is a football simulation video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts under the EA Sports label. It was released on all popular gaming formats in September 2007 in Europe, Australia and Asia, and in October 2007 in North America. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game feature an improved game engine with superior graphics and different commentators and are dubbed "next-generation" by EA. On all other platforms—including the PC—the game utilizes an older engine. The Nintendo DS version features fewer teams, stadiums, game modes and kits due to the limitations of the machine's storage medium.
Commentary comes from Sky Sports' Martin Tyler and Andy Gray on next generation consoles. However, ITV Sport's Clive Tyldesley partners Gray on current generation consoles, and the PC version of the game. On the Nintendo DS version of the game, Tyldesley commentates solo. It also marks the first time the GameCube has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA 2001 and the first the original Xbox and Game Boy Advance has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA Football 2002.
The tagline for the game is "Can You FIFA 08?". The theme song is "Sketches (20 Something Life)" by La Rocca, from the album The Truth.
