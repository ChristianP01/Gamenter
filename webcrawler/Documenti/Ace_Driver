Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Ace Driver is a 1994 racing arcade game developed and published by Namco. The player controls a Formula One racer, with the objective being to complete three laps of a race course and to avoid a collision with opponents and other obstacles. Three difficulty levels are available, as is a mode to enable a gear shift. Similar to Namco's own Final Lap series, the arcade cabinet can be linked together with another unit to enable eight-person multiplayer. It ran on the Namco System 22 arcade hardware.
Ace Driver was designed by Tatsuro Okamoto, his known for his work on the classic arcade game Metro-Cross (1985). He was assisted by Pole Position designer Shinichiro Okamoto. The game was a widespread success, winning the "Best Coin-Operated Game" award at the 76th Annual IAAPA tradeshow in November 1994. Critics praised the game's realistic graphics, multiplayer and responsive controls, with some reviewers finding it to be superior than Sega's Daytona USA and Namco's own Ridge Racer. It was followed by two sequels, Ace Driver: Victory Lap (1995) and Ace Driver 3: Final Turn (2008). A PlayStation home conversion announced in 1995 went unreleased.
