Descrizione: Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner is a turn-based role-playing video game developed by Gaia and published by Sony Computer Entertainment and Atlus for the PlayStation Portable console.  The game was released in February 2006 in Japan and in February 2007 in North America.
The game takes place in a world where monsters and human beings once lived in harmony.  The monsters were hunted and many of them were eventually imprisoned in devices called "jewels".  Once trapped in a jewel, a monster becomes tame and servile to the owner of the jewel, allowing human warriors, called Jewel Summoners, to use them in combat against other monsters.  The story of Jewel Summoner revolves around the quest for vengeance of one such warrior, Vice, whose mother died at the hands of a monster.
Jewel Summoner received mixed reviews from the gaming press.  Its monster-collection theme and turn-based gameplay was often compared to Nintendo's Pok√©mon series.  The game's audio and voice acting were praised, but its story and gameplay were criticized as uninspired and monotonous.
