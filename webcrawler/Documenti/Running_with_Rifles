Titolo: Running with Rifles

Descrizione: Running with Rifles (stylized as RUNNING WITH RIFLES) is a top down open world tactical shooter game published and developed by Osumia Games (previously Modulaatio Games). It was developed by Pasi Kainiemi in Tampere, Finland and Jack Mayol in Stuttgart, Germany, working under the team name Modulaatio Games (now Osumia Games). The game is primarily voxel-based, with the map texturing done using "splat map" texture layering, and with the modeling being done with typically low-poly or simple .mesh files. Because of this, the game runs very well on old hardware, making it more accessible to more players.
