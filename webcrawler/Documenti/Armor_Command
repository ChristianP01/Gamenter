Titolo: Armor Command

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Armor Command is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game developed by American studio Ronin Entertainment and published by Ripcord Games for Windows in 1998. Set in the early 30th century, the game revolves around two factions, the United Terran Federation led by humanity, and the Vrass, a feudal slaver empire led by aliens. Armor Command was designed by Edward Kilham, known as the co-designer of Star Wars: TIE Fighter. Armor Command released to generally positive and lukewarm reviews, although seen as obscure in comparison to more notable games in the genre. The game's publishers and developers have since become defunct, and the game is now abandonware.
