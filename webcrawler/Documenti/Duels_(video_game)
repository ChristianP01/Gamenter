Titolo: Duels (video game)

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Duels was a free player vs. player browser game.  A player's avatar could either fight another player controlled avatar, or an NPC to gain experience points, gold, and tokens.  Tokens were used to purchase packs containing scrolls, armor, and weapons.  Gold was used to purchase armor, weapons, pets, and, in Duels 2.0, actions.  Players were given the option to issue challenges to each other. When a player accepted a challenge, the avatars fought it out in real time, but without player interaction. As such, players did not need to be logged in to engage in battle. Duels offered paid memberships called Nobles or Patrons with many useful perk choices, and non-member players could purchase Challenge Coins which gave access to some of these more advanced menu choices for playing, but the game was not pay to play.
