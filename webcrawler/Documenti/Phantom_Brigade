Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Phantom Brigade is a turn-based tactics video game originally developed by Tetragon Works, but currently being developed by Brace Yourself Games after they acquired the indie studio. It released in early access on Epic Games Store on November 16, 2020, and is planned to release on Steam for its 1.0 release. The premise of the game is that the player commands a squad of mechs who obtained a secret prototype weapon that lets them see briefly into the future. The game plays out in a semi-real-time manner with turns being separated into segments of a few seconds each. The player can predict what happens during these turns and set up moves that then play out in real time.
