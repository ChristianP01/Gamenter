Titolo: Landstalker

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole (ランドストーカー 皇帝の財宝, Randosutōkā: Kōtei no Zaihō) is an action role-playing game that was developed by Climax Entertainment and released for the Sega Genesis in 1992 in Japan and 1993 elsewhere. Players take on the role of a treasure hunter named Nigel (Ryle in Japan and France, Niels in Germany) as he navigates a three-dimensional world through an isometric viewpoint, solving puzzles and fighting enemies.
The game was a major critical and commercial success. A spinoff called Lady Stalker: Challenge from the Past was released in Japan for the SNES in 1995. No official sequel to Landstalker was ever produced, but the Sega Saturn game Dark Savior (developed by the same company) and the PlayStation game Alundra (developed by Matrix Software, but with several members of the Landstalker programming and design team) are considered its spiritual successors. The main characters from Landstalker, Nigel and Friday, reappear in the Dreamcast game Time Stalkers.
It has been re-released several times: on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007, Steam in 2011, and on the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019. A remake for the PlayStation Portable was announced in 2005, but was later cancelled.
