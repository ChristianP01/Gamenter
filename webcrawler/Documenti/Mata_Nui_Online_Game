Descrizione: Mata Nui Online Game (also known as Mata Nui Adventure Game or Mata Nui: The Online Game)  is a 2001 point-and-click adventure browser game developed by Templar Studios to promote the Lego Bionicle  line of constructible action figures. The game follows Takua, a villager on the island of Mata Nui, as he explores the island, encountering other villagers and the Toa, heroic elemental warriors, on their quest to defeat the evil Makuta.
The game was developed and released episodically on the official Bionicle website throughout 2001, launching in January and concluding in December. It was later re-released in 2006 in downloadable form and in 2013 by Templar on their website. Following the cancelation of Lego Bionicle: The Legend of Mata Nui, Mata Nui Online Game became the primary vehicle for the 2001 Bionicle story. The game was highly popular and is credited with helping to establish the success of the toy line. It received awards from the marketing industry, and retrospective reviews have highlighted its expansion of the concept of what Lego-related play can be and its popularity among fans of Bionicle.
