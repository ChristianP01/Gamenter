Titolo: Mega Man Maverick Hunter X

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is a action-platforming video game developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation Portable (PSP); it is a remake of the 1993 video game Mega Man X originally released for the Super NES, the first game in the series of the same name; in the game, players control Mega Man X as he attempts to stop Sigma from leading the human race to extinction. It was first released in Japan on December 15, 2005, followed by a North American release on January 31, 2006.
Development began with Keiji Inafune discussing with his development team about whether they should make a Mega Man X9 or a remake of the first game for the PSP, with them deciding on a remake due to wanting to take advantage of the new hardware. Due to being on newer hardware, Maverick Hunter X features full 3D graphics instead of the 2D graphics used in the 1993 original, alongside other improvements and extra features.
Upon release, Maverick Hunter X was met with positive reviews from critics, who praised its updated presentation and story, although the music was met with mixed reception; despite this, the game was a commercial failure, leading to Capcom cancelling future remakes of Mega Man. The game was later made available on the PlayStation Vita in February 2012; another Mega Man X game wouldn't be released until Mega Man X DiVE in 2020.
