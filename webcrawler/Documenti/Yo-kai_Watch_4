Titolo: Yo-kai Watch 4

Anno: 2019

Descrizione: Yo-kai Watch 4 is a action role-playing video game developed and published by Level-5 for the Nintendo Switch. As indicated by the name, it is the fourth game of the main series of Yo-kai Watch video games; unlike the preceding Yo-kai Watch 3, 4 was initially released only as a single version in Japan in June 2019. An enhanced version named Yo-kai Watch 4++ was released for the Switch and PlayStation 4 in Japan in December 2019.
As with the other games in the series, the protagonist possesses the eponymous Yo-kai Watch, a device that allows them to see, befriend, and summon creatures called Yo-kai. Yo-kai Watch 4 is set in three distinct time periods. Characters from the first three games, including Keita Amano (localized as Nathan Adams for prior western releases) and Fumika Kodama (localized as Katie Forester), are in one time period. Another time period is set 30 years after the other main series games, using playable characters that were introduced in the Yo-kai Watch Shadowside: Oni-≈ç no Fukkatsu film, including Natsume Amano, the daughter of Keita and Fumika. The final time period is set in the 1960s, approximately 30 years prior to the other games, with characters from the Yo-kai Watch: Forever Friends movie, including Shin Shimomachi.
