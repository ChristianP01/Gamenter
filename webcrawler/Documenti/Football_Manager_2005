Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Football Manager 2005, known as Worldwide Soccer Manager 2005 in North America, is a football management simulation video game for PC Windows and Mac developed by Sports Interactive and published by Sega. It is the inaugural entry in the new Football Manager series, and was succeeded by Football Manager 2006.
Commonly known as FM 2005, it competed directly with Championship Manager 5, the severely delayed and widely slated effort from Eidos-funded Beautiful Game Studios.
It became the fifth fastest-selling PC game of all time at the time according to Chart-Track as well as the fastest selling game from Sega Europe at the time. The Macintosh version of the game came on the same dual format disk as the Windows version, so its sales were also included.
This was the first game from Sports Interactive that was published in North America.
