Titolo: Captain Quazar

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Captain Quazar is a science fiction third-person action game by developer Cyclone Studios, first published in 1996 by 3DO. Though initially released as an exclusive for 3DO's Interactive Multiplayer console, after the system was discontinued, Captain Quazar was ported to the Windows 95 PC platform in 1997 (a route followed by many other 3DO console titles).
The game is a tongue-in-cheek science fiction adventure. The player controls the title character—a not-too-bright, futuristic, Rambo-style law enforcement officer—as he crosses the galaxy on missions for his irate police chief.
