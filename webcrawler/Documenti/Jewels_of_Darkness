Titolo: Jewels of Darkness

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Jewels of Darkness (formerly the Middle-Earth Trilogy) is a trilogy of text adventure games by Level 9. The individual games were initially released separately in 1983. They featured some themes and names inspired by the books of J. R. R. Tolkien and so became known as the Middle-Earth Trilogy. The individual releases were available for the BBC Micro unlike the compilation.
In 1986 the three games were revised, expanded and rereleased together as a compilation. For legal reasons the references to Middle Earth were removed and the trilogy was retitled Jewels of Darkness. The games include simple static graphics.
