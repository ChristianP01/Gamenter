Descrizione: Leadfoot: Stadium Off-Road Racing, or Leadfoot for short, is a computer video game by the now defunct Ratbag Games. It is a spin-off of the dirt track racing series by Ratbag, which includes Dirt Track Racing, Dirt Track Racing: Sprint Cars and Dirt Track Racing 2. It is a racing game simulation reproducing the sport of stadium off-road racing. Pick-up trucks and buggies race around dirt tracks built inside stadiums - Supercross on four wheels. The tracks are short and tight, and are packed with jumps and other stunt features. The result is tight, close racing with plenty of fender banging.
