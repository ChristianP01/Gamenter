Titolo: Michael Jackson's Moonwalker

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is the name of several video games based on the 1988 Michael Jackson film Moonwalker. Sega developed two beat 'em up video games, released in 1990; one released for arcades and another released for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System consoles. U.S. Gold also published various games for home computers the same year. Each of the games' stories loosely follow the story of the film (specifically the "Smooth Criminal" segment), in which Michael Jackson must rescue kidnapped children from the evil Mr. Big, and incorporate synthesized versions of some of the musician's songs. Following Moonwalker, Jackson collaborated with Sega on several other video games.
