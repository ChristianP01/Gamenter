Titolo: Airheart

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Airheart is an action game designed and programmed by Dan Gorlin for the Apple II and published by Broderbund. It requires a 128K Apple IIe (or later) to run, as it uses double hi-res graphics. Airheart is a precursor to Gorlin's Typhoon Thompson in Search for the Sea Child for 16-bit computers, which is closer to what he originally envisioned for this game.
