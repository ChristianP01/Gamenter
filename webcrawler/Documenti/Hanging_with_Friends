Descrizione: Hanging with Friends is a defunct multi-player word game developed by Zynga with Friends (formerly Newtoy, Inc.), which also developed Words with Friends. Players took turns guessing words, similar to Hangman, with either friends or random opponents. Released by Zynga in June 2011, the game was available for cross-platform play on iPhone and Android.Players who challenge opponents must create a word between four and eight letters long, using the letters provided to them. The challenge is then sent to a player who must guess the word with a limited number of guesses (number of guesses based on the number of letters used to make the word; the longer the word, the fewer guesses the player gets). The exchange of challenges and guesses continues until one player uses all five of their balloons and their avatar falls into a pit of lava or other deathtrap. Players have lifelines at their disposal that can either restore guesses, reveal letters that may be part of the word, or remove letters that are not part of the word they are trying to guess. The game was a freemium game, meaning there was no cost to play, but players had the option to purchase premium content. On 19 February 2018 the game announced it would be retired on 26 March 2018.
