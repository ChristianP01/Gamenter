Titolo: The Lord of the Rings Online: War of Three Peaks

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: The Lord of the Rings Online: War of Three Peaks is the eighth expansion for the MMORPG The Lord of the Rings Online, released on October 20, 2020. Announced as a "mini-expansion pack", it is smaller than other expansions in both scope and price, comparable to 2009's Siege of Mirkwood. Unlike all previous expansions, it did not raise the game's level cap. Instead, a new type of quests called "Missions" was introduced, which scale to the player character's level, allowing players across all levels to participate. Story-wise, the War of Three Peaks is a prelude to the Fate of Gundabad expansion released in November 2021 and depicts the beginning of the Seventh War of Dwarves and Orcs, in which the Longbeards led by Prince Durin attempt to reclaim their ancestral home. In addition to the new area situated before the Gates of Gundabad, the expansion also added a new 6-man instance, a 12-man raid and boar mounts inspired by The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies.
