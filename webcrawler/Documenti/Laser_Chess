Titolo: Laser Chess

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Laser Chess is a two-player, strategy video game from 1987, modeled as a board game with chess-like pieces, most of which have mirrored surfaces, and one of which is a laser cannon. Laser Chess first appeared in Compute!'s Atari ST Disk & Magazine in 1987, written in Modula-2, winning the $5,000 first prize in a programming competition held by the magazine. 
Ports of the game written in BASIC and machine language were published in the June 1987 issue of Compute! for the Amiga, Commodore 64, Apple II, and Atari 8-bit family as type-in programs. Laser Chess has been re-implemented many times over the years, including a variant Advanced Laser Chess with a larger board and additional pieces, or the new variant "LASER CHESS: Deflection" bringing a level editor, more and more pieces like portals available on Steam.
