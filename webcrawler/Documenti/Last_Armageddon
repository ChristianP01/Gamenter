Descrizione: Last Armageddon (ラストハルマゲドン, Rasuto Harumagedon) is a 1988 post-apocalyptic role-playing video game for the NEC PC-8801, MSX, Sharp X68000, MS-DOS, PC Engine CD-ROM², and Nintendo Family Computer. The game was exclusively in the Japanese language until an English translation patch was created for the Nintendo Famicom.Described to be the antithesis of the Dragon Quest series, the introductory story deals with life after all organisms (humans and animals) have been wiped out by a mysterious force. All of the music in this game is considered to be representative of Hiroharu Hayama's early works; he was a composer for Japanese video games during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hayama often used his music to make games feel spooky and dark.
The game had a sequel, After Armageddon Gaiden, released for the Sega CD in 1994. Working Designs planned to release the game in North America as A Side Story of Armageddon in 1995, but the localization was cancelled due to the demise of the Sega CD system.
