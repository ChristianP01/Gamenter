Titolo: SonSon

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: SonSon (Japanese: ソンソン) is an arcade video game by Capcom released in July 1984. It is loosely based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West. The player assumes the role of a monkey boy (who is patterned after Sun Wukong from the story) and fights their way from one side to another, eventually reaching the statue of Buddha. One battles bats, rats, and mad bombers along the way with his stout fighting rod that shoots balls of fire. 
The game was ported from the arcade to the Family Computer in Japan. A sequel, titled SonSon II, heavily based on Black Tiger, was released for the PC Engine, published by NEC Avenue. According to composer Manami Matsumae, the PC Engine title was made by Capcom, one of a few games that they developed themselves for the console.
