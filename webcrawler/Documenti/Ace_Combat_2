Titolo: Ace Combat 2

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Ace Combat 2 is a 1997 air combat video game developed and published for the PlayStation by Namco. It is the sequel to Air Combat and the second in the Ace Combat franchise, with gameplay being presented in a more arcade-like format. The player controls one of 24 different fighter jets through 21 different missions with certain objectives to fulfill, such as protecting a base from enemy fire, intercepting a squadron of enemies, or taking down an aircraft carrier.
Conceived by Namco designer Masanori Kato, Ace Combat 2 was created out of Kato's dissatisfaction with the original Air Combat, feeling from a technical standpoint it was severely lacking. Along with a small group of others, Kato set out to create a follow-up that greatly improved on the original, featuring improved graphics, a variety in missions, and providing a true sense of flight for the player. Missions were created to be exciting and fun to play, with the gameplay itself being designed to mimic the typical style of arcade games.
Ace Combat 2 was a commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies in Japan by May 1998. It was commended by critics for its gameplay, graphics, variety in missions, and improvements over its predecessor. Some also called it one of the best flight-sim games on the PlayStation. The lack of a multiplayer mode and its high-difficulty level were the subject of criticism. A remake for the Nintendo 3DS, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy, was released in 2011.
