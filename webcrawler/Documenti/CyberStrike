Descrizione: CyberStrike is a futuristic 3D combat online game by Simutronics, involving team combat between customizable mechs, each of which is controlled by a different player.
Initially exclusive to the GEnie online service, it opened in February 1993, and later that year it caused Computer Gaming World to create the new category of "Online Game of the Year" so it could be awarded to CyberStrike. In 1994, it was offered in stores by MicroProse.
In 1997, a sequel, Cyberstrike 2, was announced as a joint project between Simutronics and Sony's 989 Studios.  A single-player mission-based version was released in stores, and a multiplayer version opened on GEnie in December 1998.  It was also released on America Online, and then via the Simutronics website.  After Cyberstrike 2 opened, the original version of the game was renamed as CyberStrike Classic.
