Descrizione: Earthrise is a science fiction player vs player massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) by independent Bulgarian developer Masthead Studios released on February 2011.The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting where the surviving population of the Earth has built a new society ruled by a totalitarian government while armed factions fight for resources and power within the new system. Among other features, a few of note are a skill-based advancement system, a player-driven economy and an emphasis on free PvP. The game uses the Earthrise Engine, an engine that was to be used for the cancelled Fallout Online.
Citing that the game was released "too early" and that it "did not meet the expectations of its fans", Masthead Studios shut down the Earthrise servers on February 9, 2012.   A press release was sent to many of the gaming sites along with a post on the official forums giving additional details.   The announcement also mentioned that the previously planned conversion to a free-to-play model is now dependent on future investor and/or publisher interest.
