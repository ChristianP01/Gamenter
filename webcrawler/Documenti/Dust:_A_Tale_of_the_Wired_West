Titolo: Dust: A Tale of the Wired West

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Dust: A Tale of The Wired West is a computer game made for PC and Macintosh. It was released on June 30, 1995, and was produced by Cyberflix and published by GTE Entertainment.
The game is a point-and-click adventure in which the player, playing a character called The Stranger, travels around a virtual old western desert town in the New Mexico desert in 1882. In addition to the main gameplay, there are several minigames in Dust, including blackjack and poker games where the player can choose to play honestly or cheat, and a shooting range which helps prepare the player for a later segment of the game.
The characters encountered in Dust are rendered by way of photographs of professional actors given limited animation in sync with dialogue. A later game produced by the same company, Titanic: Adventure Out of Time, uses the same technique and contains several references to Dust, including a reappearance of the character Buick Riviera.
Dust: A Tale of the Wired Westâ€”The Official Strategy Guide (Prima Publishing, 1995; re-released by the author, 2019) was written by Steve Schwartz in cooperation with Cyberflix.
