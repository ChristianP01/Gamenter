Descrizione: Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Nippon Ichi Software. It was initially released for PlayStation 2 on March 17, 2005 in Japan, July 26, 2005 in North America, and October 25, 2005 in Europe. An enhanced port of the game, Phantom Kingdom Portable, was released for PlayStation Portable in Japan on October 6, 2011. The game was later ported to Windows as Makai Kingdom: Reclaimed and Rebound, and to Nintendo Switch as part of the Prinny Presents NIS Classics Vol. 2 compilation, with those versions scheduled for worldwide release in Spring 2022.
A spin-off of the Disgaea series, the game follows a godlike being, Overlord Zetta, after he attempts to avert the destruction of his Netherworld and, due to his foolishness, is forced to confine his soul to the Sacred Tome, a reality-controlling book. He is forced to seek out other Overlords for assistance in reconstructing his Netherworld. The PSP, Windows and Switch versions also contain Petta Mode, a route featuring Zetta's future daughter, Petta, who has gone back in time. The game was praised by critics for its humorous dialog, story and deep gameplay, although it was criticized by some as too similar to previous games from the publisher.
