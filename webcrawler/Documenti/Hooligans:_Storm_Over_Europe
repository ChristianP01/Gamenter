Titolo: Hooligans: Storm Over Europe

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Hooligans: Storm Over Europe is a video game recreating the hooliganism which often accompanies international football matches throughout much of Europe.
The game was released in 2002 on the PC platform to immediate controversy due to its violent content and the perceived promotion of criminal behaviour in football, with some politicians calling for it to be banned. A similar media and political reaction had occurred on release of other controversial video games at the time such as Grand Theft Auto, Postal and Carmageddon, all of which featured or encouraged behaviour which would be illegal in real life; for instance, the Grand Theft Auto series features carjacking, excessive speeding and running over pedestrians. The Dutch producers of the game, Darxabre, defended the title stating that it rewarded strategic thinking rather than violence (see BBC News).
