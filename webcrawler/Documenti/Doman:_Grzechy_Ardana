Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Doman: Grzechy Ardana (English: Doman: Sins of Ardan) is a side-scrolling Hack and Slash Beat 'em up computer game released by the Polish developer World Software for the Commodore Amiga in 1995. Taking on a sword and sorcery theme akin to Conan The Barbarian, it is a spiritual successor to World Software's earlier game Franko: The Crazy Revenge and is based on the artist's Mariusz Pawluk's unpublished short story that is included alongside the game. It ended up being World Software's last release for the Amiga (the developer did later develop a more family-friendly Draggy & Croco, but the publisher they picked for this game forgot to put the game onto the selves despite being essentially complete).
