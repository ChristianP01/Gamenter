The player controls a lone green army men soldier in tan army men soldier territory. The green soldier must complete objectives across 15 levels in order for the player to complete the game. Reception was mixed, noting that the game was an improvement over others in the Army Men video game series, but still finding fault with the game's level design and missions.
