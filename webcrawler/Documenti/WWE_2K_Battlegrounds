Titolo: WWE 2K Battlegrounds

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: WWE 2K Battlegrounds is a professional wrestling video game developed by Saber Interactive and published by 2K Sports. It was released on September 18, 2020, in lieu of 2K's normal yearly WWE game, which was cancelled due to development troubles, low sales, and the negative reception from the previously released WWE 2K20.
Much like Saber's NBA Playgrounds, Battlegrounds is more of a fast-paced, arcade-style fighting game than the more realistic main entries to the WWE 2K series. Its fighting style has been compared to WWE All Stars (2011).The game released to mixed reviews, with critics praising the art style and co-operative gameplay modes, but criticizing the use of microtransactions and lack of gameplay features.
