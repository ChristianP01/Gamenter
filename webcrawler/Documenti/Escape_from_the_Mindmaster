Titolo: Escape from the Mindmaster

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Escape from the MindMaster was a video game
for the Starpath Supercharger addon for the Atari 2600 published in 1982 by Starpath.
Escape from the MindMaster utilizes a tape cassette through the Starpath Supercharger. This is used to bypass the 2K limitation of available memory in the Atari 2600. Each game has 6 levels, 2 levels per load, giving an effective total of 6K for each game, which allows for better graphics and more complicated gameplay than the average 2K cartridge. A port of this game for the Atari 7800 was planned, and a prototype version of the game was created, but these plans were shelved after Starpath merged with Epyx in 1984.
