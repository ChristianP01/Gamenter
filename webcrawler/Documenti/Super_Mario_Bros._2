Titolo: Super Mario Bros. 2

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Super Mario Bros. 2 is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was first released in North America in October 1988, and in the PAL region the following year. The Western release of Super Mario Bros. 2  was based on Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic, a Family Computer Disk System game meant to tie-in with Fuji Television's media technology expo, called Yume Kōjō (lit. Dream Factory). The characters, enemies, and themes of the game were meant to reflect the mascots and theme of the festival. After Nintendo of America found the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (later released internationally as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels in 1986) to be too difficult and similar to its predecessor, Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic was modified to become Super Mario Bros. 2 for release outside of Japan.: 2 Super Mario Bros. 2 was a commercial success as a top seller for years, and a critical success in all design aspects and for differentiating the Mario series. The international Super Mario Bros. 2 was re-released in Japan for the Famicom as Super Mario USA (1992), as part of the Super Mario All-Stars (1993) collection for the Super NES (including the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 as The Lost Levels), and as Super Mario Advance (2001) for the Game Boy Advance.
