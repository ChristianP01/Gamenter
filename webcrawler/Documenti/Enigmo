Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Enigmo and Enigmo 2 are respectively 2.5D and 3D arcade-style computer games for Windows, Mac OS 9, Mac OS X, iOS and PlayStation Minis developed by Pangea Software. They both involve moving certain substances into their proper containers. The music in both games was recorded by Michael Beckett.
Enigmo was created in 2003 by Pangea Software and was their most successful game ever sold at the time. The graphics are three-dimensional, in a sense; but gameplay is strictly limited to the horizontal and vertical axes. Liquids (water, oil, and lava) fall from droppers and will bounce around the walls of a mechanism. Gameplay consists of manipulating a limited number of dynamic items (such as bumpers, sliders, accelerators, and sponges) to affect various streams of flowing liquid so that the droplets reach their destination: tanks specific for each liquid. The player wins the level when all tanks on the level are filled with 50 drops of the appropriate liquid. In addition to the pre-designed levels, players can create their own using the game's built-in editor and download others for free off of the Pangea website.
In 2004, Aspyr Media ported a 2003 release of Enigmo to the Windows Mobile platform.  This version was included with the Dell Axim x50v model PDA; the software is available for purchase from Dell and appears to be limited to the x50v model.In January 2011, a version of Enigmo is set to be released in the PlayStation Store as a PSP Mini. It will be developed and published by Beatshapers.In May 2011, a version of Enigmo was released for Windows Phone 7.
