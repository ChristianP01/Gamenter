Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Darksiders III is an action role-playing video game developed by Gunfire Games and published by THQ Nordic for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Stadia. It is a sequel to Darksiders II and the third entry in the Darksiders series.
The game departs from the gameplay of the previous entries and incorporates elements from Metroidvania games as well as the Souls series. Taking place before the first Darksiders game, the player controls Fury, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, in her quest to capture the Seven Deadly Sins which have taken corporeal form and escaped imprisonment. In their quest, players can use a variety of melee and magical weapons and gain experience points and currency to upgrade Fury's powers and weapons.
Darksiders III received mixed reviews upon release, with many critics highlighting the technical issues and bugs on both PC and console versions as well as the too simple combat and puzzle systems.
