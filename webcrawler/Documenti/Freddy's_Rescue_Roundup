Descrizione: Freddy's Rescue Roundup is a non-scrolling platform game for DOS released in 1984 by IBM. The goal of the game is to collect all of the roadrunners on a particular level in order to advance through the game. Doorways aid in quickly traveling across a level, while enemy robots work against the player's progress. Visually, it is similar to Broderbund's Lode Runner, but there is less emphasis on puzzles.
