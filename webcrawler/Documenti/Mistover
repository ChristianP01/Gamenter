Descrizione: Mistover (stylized as MISTOVER) is a 2019 roguelike dungeon crawler role-playing video game developed and published by Krafton for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4. Mistover is set in a ravaged world recovering from a mass invasion of monstrous creatures from another realm, and its storyline follows the journey of a party of adventuring heroes who are on a quest to discover the source of the invasion. Players navigate environments from an isometric perspective with a party of procedurally generated player characters drawn from a roster of eight character classes to fight monsters and acquire loot recovered from the exploration of levels. A phenomenon known as "mist" is prevalent throughout the game world and negatively influences its characters, monsters, and items. 
Mistover was intentionally designed to be a difficult game. The developers wanted the game's constant tension and dangerous dungeon areas to provide players with a sense of challenge and force them to make the appropriate decisions that would ensure the survival of the overall party. Many aspects of the game's gameplay design and art style were inspired by similar video games in the dungeon crawler genre, such as Darkest Dungeon and Etrian Mystery Dungeon. Mistover drew mixed reviews from video game publications following its release in October 2019. Its art style as well as aspects of its dungeon exploration and tactical turn-based combat have been praised, whereas criticism focused on its harsh gameplay systems which have been described as derivative or repetitive.
