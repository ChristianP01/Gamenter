Titolo: Amnesia Fortnight 2017

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Amnesia Fortnight 2017 is a bundle of prototypes made during a two-week public prototyping session in 2017 by Double Fine Productions, which was held in conjunction with Humble Bundle in 2017.  Everyone that paid a minimum of $1 had the opportunity to vote on 25 concept ideas from employees. After the completion of the voting period, the top two picks were developed into prototypes. In addition, Tim Schafer chose an additional prototype, and the Double Fine Productions staff that was working on Amnesia Fortnight chose another. This was done to give the team a bit of control, rather than have all of the choices be as a result of online voting. Double Fine developed these four concept ideas from employees into game prototypes that became available to those that purchased the bundle after they were completed.
In addition, fan projects were also included this year. Three fan pitches were presented in a video and everyone that paid a minimum of $1 could choose between the three pitches. All three games, Pongball, Amnesia Adventure and The Lost Dev Team were developed into prototypes by fans. The top choice, Pongball, was included with the Amnesia Fortnight downloads.
2 Player Productions filmed a documentary about the making of the prototypes, which was also released on YouTube.
