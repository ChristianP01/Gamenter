Descrizione: Defender 2000 is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed by Llamasoft and published by Atari Corporation exclusively for the Atari Jaguar on December 1995. Part of Atari Corp.'s 2000 series, it is a remake by Jeff Minter of Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar's 1981 arcade game Defender, which drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids.
Following a mostly similar premise to the original Defender with a few new additions, the player as a member of the System Defense Team taking control of the Threshold spacecraft, is tasked to protect the working space miners and defeat invading waves of aliens from the Alpha Proximian Empire, who seek to obtain the life-sustaining materials humans extract in multiple planets for an Earth that lacks natural resources in the future.
Defender 2000 received mixed but mostly positive reception since its launch. Reviewers praised the soundtrack and gameplay but many felt divided in regards to the gameplay and graphics, while others criticized the difficulty and controls.
