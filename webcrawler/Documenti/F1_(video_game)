Titolo: F1 (video game)

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: F1 (released as Formula One in the USA) is a 1993 racing video game published by Domark, based on Vroom, a game developed in 1991 for the Atari ST by French company Lankhor. It was released for the Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System, Game Gear, and Amiga.
It spawned a sequel in 1994 titled F1 World Championship Edition, and the game engine was reused in Kawasaki Superbike Challenge. It was one of the most popular racing games in the console, mostly thanks to the smooth and fast game engine.
There are no major differences between the European and North American Sega versions, except naming (the European version is simply named F1), and the lack of battery save in the American version.
