Descrizione: Splitgate (known during development under the working title Splitgate: Arena Warfare) is a free-to-play multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by 1047 Games. It was released in early access on May 24, 2019, for Linux and Microsoft Windows on Steam, and on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5 on July 27, 2021. On August 25, 2021, the developers announced that the game would stay in beta indefinitely and at the same time released Season Zero. The game revolves around Halo-inspired sci-fi combat in battle arenas where players can create wormhole portals between two points on the map that have been compared to those of the Portal series, and fire weapons or travel through those portals.
The console release for the game is considered a "re-release" as the gameplay and style were completely overhauled.
