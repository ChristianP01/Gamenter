Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Planet Hot Wheels was a massively multiplayer online racing game created by the developers of the toy car brand Hot Wheels and Mattel, Hot Wheels' parent company. The service launched in 2001.
The virtual racing game included story features based on the film Hot Wheels World Race, and used representations of real world Hot Wheels models. Users could race and play mini-games to earn credits, the currency of Planet Hot Wheels, and use them to purchase items and cars. Players could also buy specially marked Hot Wheels cars that came with a code; entering the code in the game would unlock that car model in the game, or upgrades in the form of items such as decals, paint jobs, weapons, and other components.
Planet Hot Wheels was heavily advertised in its first two years. However, in 2004, when the game had been unavailable for some time with a message on the website saying that it would be back soon, Mattel permanently removed it from the website.
