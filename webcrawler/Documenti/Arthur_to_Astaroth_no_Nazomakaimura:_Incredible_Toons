Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Arthur to Astaroth no Nazomakaimura: Incredible Toons (アーサーとアスタロトの謎魔界村 インクレディブルトゥーンズ) (lit. Arthur and Asaroth's Mysterious Demon World Village) is a 1996 puzzle video game for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation which was only released in Japan. Capcom licensed Dynamix's Sid & Al's Incredible Toons engine with a Ghosts 'n Goblins motif, so it is essentially a sequel to that game. The game was initially completed without the Ghosts 'n Goblins characters, which Capcom decided to add in at the last minute.
