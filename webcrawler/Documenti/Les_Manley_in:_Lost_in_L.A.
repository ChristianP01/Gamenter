Descrizione: Les Manley in: Lost in L.A. is the second game in the Les Manley series of adult-themed graphical adventure games. It is often compared to the Leisure Suit Larry game series as both are adult-themed adventure games with a male protagonist.

In 2020, Ziggurat Interactive acquired the publishing rights and re-released the game as a digital download on GOG.com.
