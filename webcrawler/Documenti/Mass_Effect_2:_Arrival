Titolo: Mass Effect 2: Arrival

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Mass Effect 2: Arrival is a downloadable content pack developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for the 2010 action role-playing video game Mass Effect 2. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in 2011. Set within the Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century, Arrival follows the story of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must stop an imminent invasion of a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships that plan to conquer the galaxy.
Arrival is the last downloadable content pack that was released for Mass Effect 2 and acts as a bridge for Mass Effect 3. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who criticized the gameplay for its strong emphasis on linear combat sequences, and the story and characters for their vagueness. At the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, Arrival was nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content). In 2021, the pack was remastered as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
