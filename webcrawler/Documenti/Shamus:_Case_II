Titolo: Shamus: Case II

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Shamus: Case II is a 1983 video game for the Atari 8-bit family written by Cathryn Mataga and published by Synapse Software. Mataga also wrote the original Shamus and the scrolling shooter Zeppelin. A port to the Commodore 64 by Joe Vierra was released in 1984. Although ostensibly a sequel to Shamus, the gameplay is very different, combining aspects of platform games, maze games, and even Breakout. Case II was as well received as the original.
