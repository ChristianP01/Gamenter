Descrizione: Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries is a vehicle simulation video game for Microsoft Windows, released in 2002. It is a standalone expansion of MechWarrior 4: Vengeance, based on the BattleTech MechWarrior game universe.Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries and Clan and Inner Sphere expansions were re-released for free. By April 22, 2010 Microsoft had cleared its free release and on April 30, MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries was released to the general public by MekTek as a free download. However, due to the massive influx of 100,000 downloads and web site accesses, MekTek.net and related services crashed. MekTek recovered the MekMatch match making service on May 1 and the forum was restored the next day.In the following years, MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries was no longer available free. MekTek expressed their intent to move away from the BattleTech franchise, and a new group interested in maintaining free versions appeared but encountered difficulties securing permission to continue offering the game as a free download.
