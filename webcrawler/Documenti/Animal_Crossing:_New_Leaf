Titolo: Animal Crossing: New Leaf

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Animal Crossing: New Leaf is a 2012 social simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS console. In the game, the human character takes on the role of mayor in a town populated with anthropomorphic animals. As the fourth main title in the Animal Crossing series, it was released in Japan in November 2012, and in 2013 in international territories.
While retaining gameplay from older titles, Animal Crossing: New Leaf marks a change in the series, as the player now becomes the mayor of the town. With the help of the townsfolk and a secretary it is now the player's job to make the town a better place to live.
The game received critical acclaim, with many citing the improvements upon prior entries in the series. Although the title was re-released under the Nintendo Selects banner in North America and as Happy Price Selection in Japan, an updated version with Amiibo support was released for free on the Nintendo eShop in November 2016 for owners of the original version. A retail version of the update was released as Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome Amiibo in late 2016.
