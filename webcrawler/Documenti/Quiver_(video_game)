Titolo: Quiver (video game)

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Quiver is a 3D first-person shooter released in March 1997. It was developed by ADvertainment Software and published by ESD games. (Both companies seem to have disappeared; the links provided in the game's manual are broken.)  The game was designed for MS-DOS, and it runs in up to 800Ã—600 resolution.
Quiver was primarily designed and created by Mike Taylor.  The music in Quiver was composed by David B. Schultz (also composed for Nitemare 3D).
It is similar to Doom, with some humor thrown in. The enemies are much less threatening, and there is less blood and gore. The story is simple: aliens have stolen some orbs that allow them to transport to the past, and your mission is to infiltrate their bases and recover the orbs.
