Descrizione: Power Punch II is a boxing video game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1992. The game was developed by Beam Software under supervision from Nintendo, until the latter disowned the production of the game, and as a result, it was published by American Softworks Corp. Despite its title, there was no previous "Power Punch" game.  However, Beam Software would use Power Punch II's engine again with George Foreman's KO Boxing on multiple systems the same year.
