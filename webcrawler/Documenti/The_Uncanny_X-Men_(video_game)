Titolo: The Uncanny X-Men (video game)

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: The Uncanny X-Men, sometimes referred to as Marvel's X-Men, is an action video game released by LJN for the NES in 1989. It is a licensed game based on the series of X-Men comics of the same name by Marvel Comics. The lineup of characters in the game is very close to those appearing in the 1989 animated pilot X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men.
The Uncanny X-Men is the only title by LJN that was developed by an undisclosed external developer. It has been speculated that it was either developed by Japanese studios Bothtec or possibly Pixel. However, it has never been confirmed officially. It is also the second-to-last game to be released under the Enteractive Video Games label and the last to be released before LJN was sold to Acclaim Entertainment.
