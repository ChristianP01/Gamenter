Titolo: DayZ (mod)

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: DayZ is a multiplayer open world survival third-person shooter modification designed by Dean Hall for the 2009 tactical shooter video game ARMA 2 and its 2010 expansion pack, ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead. The mod places the player in the fictional post-Soviet state of Chernarus, where a mysterious plague has infected most of the population, turning people into violent zombies. As a survivor with limited resources, the player must scavenge the world for supplies such as food, water, weapons and medicine, while killing or avoiding both zombies and other players, and sometimes non-player characters, in an effort to survive the zombie apocalypse.
DayZ has been praised for its innovative design elements. The mod reached one million players in its first four months on August 6, 2012, with hundreds of thousands of people purchasing ARMA 2 just to play it. In response to its popularity, Bohemia Interactive made a standalone game. The mod remains in continued development by its community.
During the alpha, designer Dean Hall became part of Bohemia Interactive, and the mod, retitled to Arma II: DayZ Mod, was officially released on February 21, 2013.
