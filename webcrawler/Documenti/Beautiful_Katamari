Titolo: Beautiful Katamari

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Beautiful Katamari, released in Japan as Beautiful Katamari Damacy (ビューティフル塊魂, Byūtifuru Katamari Damashii), is a video game by Namco Bandai Games for the Xbox 360.  Beautiful Katamari is the fourth game in the Katamari series of games following Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari and Me & My Katamari.
Beautiful Katamari has gained extra attention because it was originally scheduled as a PlayStation 3 title in addition to the Xbox 360, but development on the PlayStation 3 was abandoned and Beautiful Katamari was released for the Xbox 360 alone. All previous Katamari games had been exclusively available on Sony consoles.
