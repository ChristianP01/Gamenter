Descrizione: Darklands is a historical fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by MicroProse in 1992 for MS-DOS. The game is set in the Holy Roman Empire during the 15th century. While the geographic setting is historically accurate, the game features many supernatural elements.
Darklands received mixed reviews upon release, with praise for its historical detail and open-ended gameplay but criticism directed at its numerous bugs and repetitive nature.
