Descrizione: Big Beach Sports is a sports game for the Wii developed by HB Studios and produced by THQ.
The game is a collection of six sports simulations, in which players compete on a beach resort location. The sports include: American football, volleyball, soccer,  bocce, cricket and disc golf.

Big Beach Sports also features the first cricket game on the Wii. It was released on 24 June 2008.
