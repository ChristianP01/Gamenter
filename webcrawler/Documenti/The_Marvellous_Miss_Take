Titolo: The Marvellous Miss Take

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: The Marvellous Miss Take is a 2014 stealth video game developed by Wonderstruck and published by Rising Star Games. The player character Sophia Take is the heiress to her great-aunt's art collection, which is sold off to private collectors. The objective of the game is to steal the collection, displayed in art galleries across London, while avoiding security measures such as guards and cameras. Designed to have only nonviolent gameplay, the game was released in November 2014 for Windows and macOS. Reviewers praised the diversity of mechanics offered by additional player characters besides Sophia, but criticised the level design as repetitive and inhibiting gameplay.
