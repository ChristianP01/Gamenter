Descrizione: F-15 Strike Eagle III is an F-15 Strike Eagle combat flight simulator released in 1992 by MicroProse and is the sequel of F-15 Strike Eagle and F-15 Strike Eagle II. It is the final game in the series.
The plane is equipped with a M61 Vulcan and both air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, as well as free-fall and laser-guided bombs. Available scenarios are:  Iraq, Panama, and Korea. Missions usually involve taking out one primary and one secondary target, while avoiding attacking friendly targets. The player can receive promotions and medals based on their mission scores.
For its time, Strike Eagle III boasted impressive graphics, although enemy planes are not nearly as detailed as the player's F-15. Special attention was put into the terrain and geography, to the extent that real buildings and geographical sites are visible ingame, such as the Iraqi Presidential Palace in Baghdad.
The enhanced CD-ROM edition adds 15 minutes of introductory video, a tutorial, and new scenarios, including flight missions based on those of the Desert Storm campaign.
