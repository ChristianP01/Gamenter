Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Jam with the Band, known in Japan as Daigasso! Band Brothers DX, is a music video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It is the sequel to the Japan-exclusive Daigasso! Band Brothers, which was released at the DS' launch. Jam with the Band was released in Japan in June 2008 and in Europe in May 2010. It uses the largest save capacity for a Nintendo DS game at eight megabytes. Its release was accompanied by a Wii Channel for the Wii console called the Live Channel, known in Japan as the Speaker Channel, that allows players to hear the game's sound through their television. It features the character Barbara Bat, who was also in the predecessor.
It has been very well received commercially. It sold more than 120,000 copies in Japan in its first four days of release; at approximately 424,477 units, it sold well enough to become the 24th best-selling game of 2008 in Japan. It has also received positive reception. Jam with the Band features more than 60 instruments that can be played. Its gameplay focuses on button input similar to its predecessor, which involves notes that scroll down and an arrow to indicate when to hit them. Players may create and download songs, though the download limit was 100 due to JASRAC licensing issues. The Japanese list of songs consisted of more than 4,000 songs. Players could preview the song before downloading, and also rate them on a scale of one to five. The game was followed up in 2013 by the Japan-only release of the Nintendo 3DS game Daigasso! Band Brothers P.
