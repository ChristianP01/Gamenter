Originally known as Charles Barkley Basketball during development and initially released on the Genesis, it was later ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and first released on North America in June 1994 and this version was released months later in both Japan and Europe on the same year by Den'Z and Sony Electronic Publishing respectively.Barkley Shut Up and Jam! received mixed but positive reception when it was released on both platforms, with reviewers praising the graphics, sound and multiplayer, while others criticized the controls, lackluster animations and gameplay, with critics also comparing the game with NBA Jam. Ports for the PC and Atari Jaguar were in development but never released. A sequel, Barkley Shut Up and Jam 2, was exclusively released for the Genesis in 1995.
