Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Grabbed by the Ghoulies is an action-adventure video game developed by Rare and published by Microsoft Game Studios exclusively for the Xbox. It was first released in North America in October 2003, and in Europe in November. It was re-released worldwide on the Xbox 360 as a downloadable Xbox Live Originals title in February 2009. This was removed from the store in June 2015, two months before a remastered version was released as part of the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One. The game follows a young boy, Cooper, who sets out to rescue his girlfriend from a haunted mansion infested with supernatural creatures.
Having originally been in development for the GameCube, Grabbed by the Ghoulies was the first Rare game to be published by Microsoft after Rare was bought out from Nintendo. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release. Criticism was directed at the gameplay, but the game's graphics and style were praised. Grabbed by the Ghoulies was nominated for the Console Family Game of the Year prize at the 2004 Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.
