Titolo: Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars – The Director's Cut

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars – The Director's Cut is an enhanced remake and director's cut of the classic 1996 point-and-click adventure game Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars developed by Revolution Software. It was released for Wii, Nintendo DS, iOS, Microsoft Windows, OS X, Android and Linux spanning 2009 to 2012. The player assumes the roles of George Stobbart and Nicole Collard, who was a pivotal but not a playable character in the original version.
After being petitioned to bring Broken Sword to the Wii and Nintendo DS, Revolution decided to create a director's cut. Comic book artist Dave Gibbons created additional artwork for the game. The game received positive reviews from critics, and is often listed as one of the best games on the Wii, DS and iOS/Android mobile devices. It was also a commercial success, outselling the third and fourth Broken Sword installments. The Nintendo Wii version of Director's Cut differs from all other versions, as it does not include the visual hint helper system, which is typically included as a mandatory feature which cannot be disabled.
