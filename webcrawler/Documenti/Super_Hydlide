Descrizione: Super Hydlide is an action role-playing game for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It was originally released in 1987 in Japan only under the title Hydlide 3: The Space Memories (ハイドライド３ 闇からの訪問者, Haidoraido 3: Yami Kara no Hōmonsha) for the MSX, MSX2, and NEC PC-88. It's the third game in the Hydlide series. Ports were also released for the Nintendo Famicom and the Sharp X68000. The game was developed by Hydlide series veterans T&E Soft and released worldwide on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive on October 6, 1989, in Japan, early 1990 in the United States, and 1991 in Europe. This remake evidences substantial graphical upgrades to the original Hydlide 3, though the gameplay remains largely identical.
