Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Neocolonialism is a strategic computer game in which players take over different regions all over the world. It is turn-based, and allows three to six players at once. It is produced by American indie studio Subaltern Games, and designed by Seth Alter.
As in Risk, the world is divided into a number of different regions that player try to dominate. Unlike Risk, however, the goal is not to occupy as many regions as possible, but to liquidate the votes you have purchased in regions in order to put as much money as possible in a Swiss Bank account. The game lasts for twelve turns. At the end of the twelfth turn, the player who has the most money in his or her Swiss Bank account is the winner. Also, Neocolonialism differs from Risk in that the map of the world is rotated 180Â° in relation to the most common world map orientation, putting the north at the bottom.
In the introductory tutorial, the learner is player is told, "You will learn the basics of how to ruin the world." Later the player is warned, "Neocolonialism is a game about finance bankers attempting to extract as much wealth from the world as possible."
