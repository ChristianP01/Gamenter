Descrizione: Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo (機動戦士ガンダム, Kidō Senshi Gandamu, lit."Mobile Suit Gundam") is an action game based directly on the Mobile Suit Gundam films and series. The game begins at the start of the series and ends at the ending of the second film. The game plays in an action game format with a standard third-person view. It features newly hand animated cutscenes that depict events from the original television series as well as a CGI opening depicting a space battle from the One Year War and then a scene of the Gundam destroying several Zaku IIs before being attacked by Char Aznable. A sequel, Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space, was released in 2003.
The English dub of the video game features the voices of the actors who were cast for the Mobile Suit Gundam television series as with most games subsequent to the series' dubbing, rather than the English cast of the films.
