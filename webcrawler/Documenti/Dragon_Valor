Descrizione: Dragon Valor (ドラゴンヴァラー, Doragon Varā) is an action role-playing platform video game developed and released by Namco for the Sony PlayStation on December 2, 1999, in Japan. It is the third game in the Dragon Buster series, and features a platform and hack and slash elements.
In the Dragon Valor world, dragons are monsters with immense power; the player's role as a Dragon Valor is to slay them with a magical sword that is passed down through successive generations of the family. In a manner somewhat reminiscent of Phantasy Star III, the game differs from other platform action games of the time in that whom the protagonist marries during the game will influence who will lead the adventure in its next phase. There are two choices in the first chapter, and a possible two choices in the second chapter; hence, the game flow has three potential paths and thus three different endings.
