Descrizione: CSI: Hard Evidence is a computer and Xbox 360 game based on the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation television series. This is the fifth CSI game released, including CSI: Miami.
As with the previous CSI games, there are five cases to work on. However, the game includes improvements on CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder, like a 3D crime scene kit. The voice of Sara Sidle is again performed by a soundalike (Kate Savage) and not Jorja Fox. Catherine Willows is also replaced by a soundalike in this game, with Edie Mirman standing in for Marg Helgenberger.
This is Telltale's first console game which was released inline with the PC version. It is Telltale's first Xbox 360 and Wii game. A Mac OS X version was later released by TransGaming, using their Cider technology.
