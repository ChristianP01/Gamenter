Descrizione: Mega Man Star Force, known in Japan as Ryūsei no Rockman (流星のロックマン, Ryūsei no Rokkuman, Shooting Star Rockman), is an action role-playing video game, and the first installment of the Star Force series, a spin-off series in the Mega Man franchise. It was published and developed by Capcom for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. It was released on December 14, 2006 in Japan, and in North America on August 7, 2007.
The game was released in three separate versions simultaneously, subtitled Pegasus (ペガサス, Pegasasu), Leo (レオ, Reo), and Dragon (ドラゴン, Doragon), and each version contains exclusive cards and transformations. However, the Dragon version was initially released exclusively to GameStop and EB Games stores in North America.Despite the similarities, Mega Man Star Force is separate from the Mega Man Battle Network series, taking place many years afterward. Battle gameplay is carried out in a 3D 3-by-5 grid with Mega Man limited to moving from left to right in one row, departing from the original 3-by-3 vs. 3-by-3 playing field style. Both an anime and manga were produced several months prior to the game's Japanese release date; however, only the anime has been adapted into English so far. A sequel, Mega Man Star Force 2, was released on November 22, 2007. Because of the networking capabilities of the Nintendo DS, players are now able to play against each other, trade battle cards, and form a Brother Band Network in the game via wireless connectivity.
