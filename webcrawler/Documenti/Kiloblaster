Titolo: Kiloblaster

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Kiloblaster is a fixed shooter video game trilogy written by Allen Pilgrim and published by Epic MegaGames in 1992 for IBM PC compatibles. Based on Namco's Galaxian from 1979, there are a few differences such as allowing greater player movement (horizontally and vertically), much faster enemy movement, power-ups, enemies that take more than one hit, and allies to assist in battle.
Allen Pilgrim declared the registered version freeware and released also the source code on August 4, 2008. Following that, ports with SDL to new platforms and mobile devices like the Pandora were created.
