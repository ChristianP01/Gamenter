Titolo: Scram (video game)

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Scram: A Nuclear Power Plant Simulation is an Atari 8-bit family game written by Chris Crawford and published by Atari, Inc. in 1981. Written in Atari BASIC, Scram uses differential equations to simulate nuclear reactor behavior. The player controls the valves and switches of the reactor directly with the joystick.
This game's title, "scram", is taken from the nuclear reactor safe-word conceived at the University of Chicago in 1942. It refers to cutting a reactor's control rods so they fall into the nuclear material and stop the reaction process. The game also recreates the Three Mile Island Unit 2 nuclear reactor, and allowed players to recreate the events that took place there in 1979.
