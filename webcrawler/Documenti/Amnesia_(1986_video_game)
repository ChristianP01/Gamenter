Titolo: Amnesia (1986 video game)

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Amnesia is a text adventure written by science fiction author Thomas M. Disch,  programmed by Kevin Bentley, and published by Electronic Arts in 1986 for IBM PC compatibles (as a self-booting disk) and Apple II. A Commodore 64 version was released in 1987. Disch's ironic, rich writing style, is in distinct contrast to the functional or tongue-in-cheek tone of most text adventures. Over half of Disch's novel-length manuscript had to be cut from the published version due to the storage limitations 5Â¼" floppy disks.
