Descrizione: Kamen Rider Battle: Ganbaride (仮面ライダーバトル ガンバライド, Kamen Raidā Batoru Ganbaraido, Masked Rider Battle: Ganbaride) is a combination of an arcade game and a collectible item game featuring the protagonists of the Kamen Rider Series. The game is being released as part of the 10th anniversary of the Heisei run Kamen Rider Series by Toei, TV Asahi, Ishimori Productions, and Bandai and features heavy tie-ins with the television series Kamen Rider Decade, whose protagonists use cards similar to those used in the game. It is played in a similar fashion to Sega's Mushiking and Dinosaur King games, and uses special Data Cardass cards released by Bandai. The game's card input uses collectible card game terminologies, and has resemblance and functionality similarly to the Decadriver in Decade. As the series progresses, the game controls change to suit the new Kamen Rider. During the airing of Kamen Rider OOO, Ganbaride arcade systems included an OOO Driver interface for the toy Core Medals, and with the broadcast of Kamen Rider Fourze, slots for the Astro Switches became available, and the system became 3 VS. 3. During the  broadcast of Kamen Rider Wizard, Wizard Rings were available to use, and the game was reverted to 2 VS. 2 battles. Ever since Kamen Rider Gaim's TV series airing until onwards, the game is now renamed to Kamen Rider Battle: Ganbarizing (仮面ライダーバトル ガンバライジング, Kamen Raidā Batoru Ganbaraizingu, Masked Rider Battle: Ganbarizing).
McDonald's restaurants in Japan have released special promotional Ganbaride cards with their Happy Meals to tie in with the various Kamen Rider films in Japanese theaters at the time.A Nintendo DS port of the game subtitled Card Battle War (カードバトル大戦, Kādo Batoru Taisen) was released on July 29, 2010.
