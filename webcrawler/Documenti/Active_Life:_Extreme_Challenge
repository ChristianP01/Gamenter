Descrizione: Active Life: Extreme Challenge (Family Trainer: Extreme Challenge in Europe and Family Trainer 2 in Japan) is a video game for the Wii platform, created by Bandai Namco Games. It is the sequel to the 2008 game Active Life: Outdoor Challenge and was released on August 11, 2009. The game uses a mat to play minigames. The game mat is different from the mat that is used in Dance Dance Revolution.
As this game's unique pad controller is designed to physically connect to the Wii via its GameCube controller ports, this game is incompatible with later Wii models, which eliminated the said ports.
