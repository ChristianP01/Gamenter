Anno: 1985

Descrizione: Dread Dragon Droom (popularly known as Droom) is an educational game designed and published by HUMMEC (Humberside Microelectronics in Education Centre) in 1985.
The game was used widely in schools throughout the United Kingdom in the 1980s and was one of the first examples of British educational software designed specifically for schools.  HUMMEC was the educational support centre of the then local education authorities of Humberside.  Humberside was part of a consortium of LEAs (the others being Barnsley, Sheffield, Doncaster, Rotherham and, for a time, Wakefield) which established a regional support centre called RESOURCE, based in Doncaster.
