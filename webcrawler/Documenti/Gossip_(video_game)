Titolo: Gossip (video game)

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Gossip is a video game created for the Atari 8-bit family by then-Atari, Inc. employee Chris Crawford. The documentation indicates that Gossip is an Atari Program Exchange title, but it was not listed in any of the published catalogs and may not have been released at all.Crawford wished for video games that would simulate aspects of human social interaction via “social challenges.” He hoped these "people games" would appeal to those who were not interested in the more common gaming genres of combat and sports. Although the social interactions in Gossip are relatively simple, Crawford contends that they are comparable to the level of complexity found in The Sims.
