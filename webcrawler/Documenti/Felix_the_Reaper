Titolo: Felix the Reaper

Anno: 2019

Descrizione: Felix the Reaper is a 2019 puzzle game developed by Kong Orange and published by Daedalic Entertainment. In each of the game's levels, players must navigate player character Felix through a series of spatial puzzles without coming into contact with the light of the sun, which requires players to manipulate the environment using various gameplay mechanics to provide pathways for Felix to reach the end of the level and fulfill his duties. Felix's goal in each scenario is to instigate deadly and often contrived accidents to claim a non-player character's life using elements within the level's environments. 
The developers of Felix the Reaper were inspired by historical artistic depictions of death, specifically the Danse Macabre concept, which depict the dead dancing on their way to the grave. The game was under development for 8 years prior to its multiplatform release in October 2019 to mixed reviews. Some critics appreciated the novelty of the game's concept and its aesthetic presentation, while others found the game's puzzles to be overly frustrating or uninspired.
