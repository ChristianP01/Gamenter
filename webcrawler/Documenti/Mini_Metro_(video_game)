Titolo: Mini Metro (video game)

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Mini Metro is a puzzle strategy video game developed by New Zealand indie development team Dinosaur Polo Club. Players are tasked with constructing an efficient rail transit network for a rapidly growing city. Stations are represented by differently shaped nodes and players can build tracks to connect them by drawing lines. Levels are based on real cities and the appearance of stations and passengers is procedurally generated. The game's visual style makes use of bold colours and simple geometry to replicate the appearance of modern transit maps. The game uses a procedural audio system to generate sounds based on the player actions and transit network. The rhythms and sounds created took inspiration from works of minimal music.
Mini Metro was conceived in April 2013 for a video game development competition, with a prototype version being released freely for web browsers. During the game's conception phase, the developers imposed a set of constraints to limit its scope and ensure the project could reach a finished state. Production of the game continued following the event and an in-development version was released commercially on Linux, OS X, and Windows in August 2014. Mini Metro received its full release on PC platforms in November 2015, on Android and iOS platforms in October 2016, plus Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 ports in 2018 and 2019 respectively.
The game had a positive reception, with praise for its intuitive interface, simple gameplay, and minimalist approach. A follow-up, Mini Motorways, was released by the studio in 2019.
