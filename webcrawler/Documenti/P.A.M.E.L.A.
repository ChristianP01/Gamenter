Descrizione: P.A.M.E.L.A. is a science fiction first-person shooter open world survival horror video game by Canadian company NVYVE Studios for Microsoft Windows. The game takes place in a science fiction, utopian city called Eden, that includes areas such as malls, courtyards, and residential condos. The gameplay is that of an open world sandbox, and contains no set path for the player to follow, forcing the player to find their own way to survive. The game also contains role-playing game-like progression, and a story to be discovered in the game world.
The game's central theme revolves around the darkness created by mankind's misguided pursuit of perfection, and the cost it has to the people living in the game world. The player assumes the role of a Sleeper, woken up from cryosleep by Eden's Artificial Intelligence Pamela. Together they must survive through and discover what happened to bring about the fall of the floating utopia.
P.A.M.E.L.A. was Greenlit on Steam by the community on October 1, 2015, after receiving a significant amount of press coverage. The game was released on 9 March 2017 in an Early Access state on Steam. On 18 June 2020 the game left early access as version 1.0 was released.
