Titolo: Werewolves of London (video game)

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Werewolves of London is a video game released in 1987 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and the Amstrad CPC. It was released on a cassette with the Amstrad version on one side and the Spectrum version on the other, this scheme being referred to as "Flippy". The game used the same engine as Viz Design's (consisting of Steve Howard and Paul Smith) other game Frankenstein Junior which was released by Codemasters in the same year. The game was released two years late (and largely unfinished) and was as a budget title, as intended publisher Ariolasoft went bankrupt (being released by Mastertronic). It was also released in Spain by Dro Soft.
The game is set in London and the plot is to kill each of eight members of an aristocratic family who put a curse on the main character, resulting in his daily transformation into a werewolf.
