Titolo: Final Fantasy Awakening

Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Final Fantasy Awakening was an action role-playing game developed by Perfect World Games and Square Enix for iOS and Android. It was first released in China by Perfect World in December 2016, with releases in other languages including English over the following two years from other publishers; its English release was the first Final Fantasy title to be licensed by Square Enix to another company. The English version closed in 2019 due to service changes, and all other versions shut down in May 2020 with the end of the licensing deal.
Awakening is set in the universe of Final Fantasy Type-0, a spin-off title within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. Players take on the role of a cadet of the Dominion of Rubrum as the four nations of Orience are plunged into war. The player engages in missions, fighting foes using hack and slash-style gameplay using parties of five characters. All gameplay is multiplayer-exclusive, featuring both cooperative and player-versus-player modes.
Planning began in 2014 after the online elements of Final Fantasy Agito stalled due to technical difficulties. According to original director Hajime Tabata, Awakening was the true realisation of his earliest plans for Type-0. The game was overseen by staff from Square Enix, while the main development was handled by Perfect World, who were chosen due to their good track record for domestic and international online games. First announced at the 2015 Tokyo Game Show, its first beta test opened in mainland China in April 2016. It met with commercial success, achieving two million downloads within its month of Chinese release. It also saw strong popular appeal and positive reviews from game journalists.
