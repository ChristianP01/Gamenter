Descrizione: The Goonies (Japanese: グーニーズ, Hepburn: Gūnīzu) is a 1986 platform game based on the film of the same name produced by Konami for various Japanese computer systems. Konami also developed a completely different version for the Family Computer in Japan. First released on cartridge, it was later re-released in Disk System format in 1988. Although the game was never sold in retail in North America, Nintendo published an arcade port in North America for the VS. System (a coin-operated platform which runs on the same hardware as the NES) under the title Vs. The Goonies and it was also available as a PlayChoice-10 title in the region. A sequel was released titled The Goonies II, which saw a worldwide retail release.
The main theme song for most of the game is a chiptune rendition of Cyndi Lauper's "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough".
