Titolo: GoatUp 2

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: GoatUp 2 is a platform game for iOS developed by Jeff Minter and Ivan Zorzin of Llamasoft and published via the App Store in 2013. It is the only Llamasoft game so far to include a level editor. The title screen gives the game's full name as "Buck! The story of GoatUp 2", a reference to the arcade game Rainbow Islands, and the game's interface and appearance resemble that platform with the exception that the font is the same Namco Galaga font used in Super Ox Wars.
