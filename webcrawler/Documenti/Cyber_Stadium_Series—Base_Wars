Descrizione: Cyber Stadium Series—Base Wars is a baseball video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
Developed by Konami for the NES, and published by Ultra Games, Cyber Stadium Series—Base Wars was released in May or June 1991 in the United States; the game did not receive a European release.  A baseball video game for one or two players, the ROM cartridge features the ability to save games, whether playing either an individual game or the ten-game pennant race.In a 24th century where baseball team owners are dissatisfied overpaying their players (e.g. US$2.4 billion per year for a lifetime .250 hitter), they have replaced the athletes with armed robots; there are four models of robot to choose from, each optimally suited for specific baseball positions.  One of the game's innovations is where upon force plays, the two opposing players fight for possession of the base; another is the ability to upgrade robots' abilities between pennant games.  If a team loses three robots in a game (to destruction from incremental damage), they forfeit the game.
