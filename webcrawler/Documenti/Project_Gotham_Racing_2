Titolo: Project Gotham Racing 2

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Project Gotham Racing 2 is a racing video game developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released exclusively for the Xbox in November 2003.
As in 2001's Project Gotham Racing, the route to advancement in Project Gotham Racing 2 differs from most racing games. Advancement in Project Gotham Racing 2 requires a combination of driving fast enough to meet the challenge set, and scoring enough Kudos points to advance. Kudos points are gained through the player's driving skills, such as power sliding around a corner at speed, or overtaking other drivers in the race. Kudos points are used to unlock new cars. The Kudos system, challenges set, available cars, and the tracks around which players race were expanded greatly from the original.
Project Gotham Racing 2 supported Xbox Live and allowed players to race against other people all around the world. The in-game garage featured the cult-classic mini-game Geometry Wars.
