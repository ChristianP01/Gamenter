Titolo: Vette!

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Vette! is a 1989 racing video game where the object is racing a Chevrolet Corvette through the streets of San Francisco. The game was notable for its (at the time) detailed un-shaded polygon rendering of San Francisco streets. It was released on three floppy disks with a Black & White or Color version available. It was also released with a large instruction manual that gave detailed specs about the cars and details about various areas in the city.
The game features a 3D rendered San Francisco, including the Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco Bay Bridge, and Lombard Street, known as the "Crookedest Street In The U.S."
A Sega Genesis version was planned but never released.
