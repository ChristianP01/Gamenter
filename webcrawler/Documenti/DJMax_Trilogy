Descrizione: DJMax Trilogy (Korean: 디제이맥스 트릴로지; abbreviation: DM TR) is a rhythm action game with five difficulty modes ranging from limited four-key gameplay to a challenging eight-key setup. As notes are played with perfect accuracy, a "fever gauge" will be charged. When it is fully charged, Fever can be activated. Fever acts as a multiplier to score and it varies between x2 and x5.
This game also requires a highly secured USB profile key, which is included in the packaging, to run the game. The USB stick is used to decrypt the encrypted game content while the game is running. The entire player's profile is also saved to the USB key. A DJMax Trilogy profile consists of several things like the player's high scores, progress and settings. Because of this, it is almost impossible to run DJMax Trilogy without the USB profile key.
The English translation of DJMax Trilogy has inconsistencies in naming and many mistranslated or misspelled words. For example, in some of the Mission descriptions (in Mission mode), words like "Achieve" have been misspelled as "Achive".
