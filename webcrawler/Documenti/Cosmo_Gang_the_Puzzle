Titolo: Cosmo Gang the Puzzle

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Cosmo Gang the Puzzle is a 1992 falling tile puzzle arcade game developed and published by Namco worldwide. The third game in its Cosmo Gang series, succeeding that year's Cosmo Gang the Video, players stack groups of blocks and aliens known as Jammers in a vertical-oriented well. The objective is to clear as many objects on the screen before they reach the top of the screen. Blocks are cleared by aligning them into complete horizontal rows, while Jammers are cleared by defeating them with blue-colored spheres.
Namco ported the game to the Super Famicom a year later in 1993. This version of the game was reworked and reskinned as Pac-Attack for North America and Europe, which was later ported to other consoles such as the Sega Genesis and Game Boy. Cosmo Gang the Puzzle was met with a mixed reception from critics, being praised for its multiplayer aspect and gameplay but criticized for its graphics. The Super Famicom version was released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008 and Wii U Virtual Console in 2015, while the arcade version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2009 â€” all of these ports were exclusive to Japan.
