Titolo: Dragon Ball Z: Attack of the Saiyans

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Dragon Ball Z: Attack of the Saiyans, known in Japan as Dragon Ball Kai: Saiyan Invasion, is a video game based on the Dragon Ball franchise for the Nintendo DS. It was released in Japan on April 29, 2009, and in Europe and North America in November 2009. The game is developed by Monolith Soft and distributed by Namco Bandai in North America (and everywhere else under the Bandai label); it is one of the first games in the Dragon Ball franchise to be published by Namco Bandai, as the company would acquire the license from previous holder Atari in July of the same year.
The game is a turn-based RPG that adapts events from the "23rd Tenkaichi Budokai" story arc to the eponymous "Saiyan" arc of the original manga. Despite the game's Japanese and Western titles, the former arc wasn't adapted into either the 1989 Dragon Ball Z anime series nor its revised version, Dragon Ball Kai, which also premiered in 2009.
Attack of the Saiyans received generally mixed reviews by gaming critics, while complimenting the battle system, its visuals, and its ability to stay true to the series. It would go on to be the third-best selling video game during the month of May 2009 in Japan.
