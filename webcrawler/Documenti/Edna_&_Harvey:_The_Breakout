Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Edna & Harvey: The Breakout (known in Germany as German: Edna bricht aus, lit.â€‰'Edna breaks out') is a 2008 adventure game for Windows starring a young woman and her toy rabbit. The objective of the game is to escape from a mental hospital which they find themselves in at the beginning of the game.
The game began as a university project in Germany. Although that version received an outstanding reception, the English game merely received a mixed reception with both average and low review scores, mostly due to the sloppy translation.
