Titolo: Monster Bash

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Monster Bash (called Graveyard during development) is a side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Apogee Software on 9 April 1993 for DOS. The game features 16-color EGA graphics and IMF AdLib compatible music. It was developed by Frank Maddin and Gerald Lindsly.
The game is divided into three episodes. The first episode of the game is available to download under a shareware license, but the two remaining parts of the game must be purchased. The registered game also removes advertisements and reminders of the benefits of purchasing the games from the first episode and enables cheat code functionality.
The game was re-released in 2014 on GOG.com with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
