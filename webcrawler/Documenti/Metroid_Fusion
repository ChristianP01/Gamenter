Titolo: Metroid Fusion

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Metroid Fusion is an action-adventure game published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld console in 2002. It was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1, which had developed the previous game in the series, Super Metroid (1994). Players control bounty hunter Samus Aran, who investigates a space station infected with shapeshifting parasites known as X.
Like previous Metroid games, Fusion is a side-scrolling game with platform jumping, shooting, and puzzle elements, but introduces mission-based progression that guides the player through certain areas. It was released the day after the GameCube game Metroid Prime in North America; both games can be linked using the GameCube â€“ Game Boy Advance link cable to unlock additional content for Prime.
Fusion was acclaimed for its tight gameplay, controls, graphics and music, though its shorter length and greater linearity received some criticism. It received several awards, including Handheld Game of the Year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards, Best Game Boy Advance Adventure Game from IGN, and Best Action Game on Game Boy Advance from GameSpot. It was rereleased on the Nintendo 3DS's Virtual Console in 2011 as part of the 3DS Ambassador Program, and the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2014. A sequel, Metroid Dread, was released in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch.
