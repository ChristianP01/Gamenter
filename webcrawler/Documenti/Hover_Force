Descrizione: Hover Force is a video game published by INTV Corporation for the Intellivision video game system in 1986. The game was initially developed by Mattel Electronics with the intent of it being played in 3-D, but the company was shut down before it could be released; INTV, after acquiring the Intellivision assets from Mattel, re-tooled the game, which pits players against a terrorist group laying siege to a city, and released it itself.
