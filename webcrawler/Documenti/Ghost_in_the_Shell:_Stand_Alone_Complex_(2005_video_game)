Descrizione: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, released in Japan as Kokaku Kidotai: Stand Alone Complex - Domain of the Hunters (攻殻機動隊 STAND ALONE COMPLEX -狩人の領域-, Kōkaku Kidōtai Sutando Arōn Konpurekkusu -Kariudo no Ryōiki-), is a first-person shooter video game based on the cyberpunk anime series Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and a sequel to the first Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex game of the same title, developed by G-Artists and published for the PlayStation Portable by Sony Computer Entertainment and Bandai in 2005. It was released in Japan on September 15, 2005, in Europe on October 21, 2005 distributed by Atari Europe, and in North America on October 26, 2005, but releasing it under the same name as the original PS2 game caused confusion and misinterpretation of it as a port.
