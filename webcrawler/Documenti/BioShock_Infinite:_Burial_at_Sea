Titolo: BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea is a two-part single-player expansion to the first-person shooter video game BioShock Infinite. It was developed by Irrational Games and published by 2K Games for Linux, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and macOS platforms. Episode One was released digitally on November 12, 2013, followed by Episode Two on March 25, 2014. A retail version was released as part of BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition, and later included in BioShock: The Collection for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
Burial at Sea is set after the events of Infinite, which spanned several alternate realities. Whereas Infinite takes place aboard the floating city Columbia, Burial at Sea primarily takes place in the underwater metropolis Rapture before the events of the first BioShock game. The game features Booker DeWitt as a private detective, and Elizabeth as a femme fatale who employs Booker's services.
Development of Infinite's downloadable content commenced immediately after finishing the main game. Irrational was drawn to returning to the setting of Rapture and using Infinite's gameplay systems to create a version of the city before its ruin in BioShock. Reception to Burial at Sea's two episodes was mixed. While the return to Rapture was generally praised, the first episode drew criticism for its short length and a lack of differentiated gameplay. Reviews for the second episode were more positive, with multiple critics calling Burial at Sea a fitting swan song for Irrational's work on BioShock, as the studio reorganized.
