Descrizione: Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes is a real-time strategy video game developed by Phantagram and published by Gathering of Developers. Released for Windows in 2001, the game is based in a high fantasy setting and is played from an overhead isometric perspective. The game included single-player and multiplayer online modes through Phantagram's Wargate server. The game is the first release in the Kingdom Under Fire series, which later received critical acclaim through the Xbox release Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders, a game which, like others in the series, incorporated both role-playing and real-time strategy elements. A "Gold Patch" was released for Kingdom Under Fire which introduced a map editor, extra missions, and in-game save option; this version was also re-released as Kingdom Under Fire Gold.
