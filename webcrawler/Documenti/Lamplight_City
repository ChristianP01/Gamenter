Descrizione: Lamplight City is a point-and-click adventure game developed by American studio Grundislav Games and released in 2018 by Application Systems Heidelberg. The game takes place within an alternate history version of 19th century America that incorporates steampunk elements, in which players take control of a private detective who tackles a series of cases while trying to uncover the identity of a criminal who caused their partner's death. Although operating like a standard point-and-click adventure game, players have no inventory and can decide how to acquire information and how a case is solved, with the game's overall ending affected by the choices made.
