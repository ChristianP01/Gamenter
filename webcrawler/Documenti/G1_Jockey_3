Descrizione: G1 Jockey 3 (ジーワンジョッキー3, Jī Wan Jokkī 3) is a thoroughbred horse racing simulation video game produced by Koei for the PlayStation 2. Although the G1 Jockey series had been gaining popularity in Japan, this was the first game in the series to be released in North America. In contrast to Tecmo's Gallop Racer series, which focuses on every aspect of horse racing (including breeding), G1 Jockey 3 focuses solely on the jockey.
