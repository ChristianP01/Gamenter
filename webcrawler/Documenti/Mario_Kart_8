Titolo: Mario Kart 8

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Mario Kart 8 is a kart racing video game developed and published by Nintendo, and first released for the Wii U in 2014. It retains Mario Kart series game mechanics, where players control Mario franchise characters in kart racing, collecting a variety of items to hinder opponents or gain advantages in the race. Mario Kart 8 introduces anti-gravity driving on walls or ceilings, and allows players to bump into each other for a short boost. It has single-player and multiplayer modes, including online via the Nintendo Network.
Mario Kart 8 was a critical and commercial success upon its release. Critics gave positive reviews, praising its new additions, tracks, graphics, gameplay, and orchestrated soundtrack, but criticizing its limited Battle mode. It is the best-selling Wii U game, with more than eight million copies sold worldwide. The game continued to receive post-release patches and downloadable content, including additional characters, vehicles, and tracks, and support for Nintendo's Amiibo line of figurines.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, an enhanced version of the game for the Nintendo Switch, was released in April 2017. It was also a critical and commercial success, becoming the Switch's best-selling game. Both versions have sold a combined total of more than 47 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling racing game, and one of the best-selling video games of all time. Critics considered the expansion of the Battle mode, containing specially designed battle stages and three new variations of the mode, a significant improvement over its predecessor.
