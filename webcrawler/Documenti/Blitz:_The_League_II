Titolo: Blitz: The League II

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Blitz: The League II is an American football video game developed Midway Games as part of its  Blitz series. It was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 13, 2008. There are five new teams included in this installment: The Los Angeles Riot, the Houston Riders, Vancouver Beavers, Milwaukee Hounds, and Atlanta 404; and four older teams have been relocated. Lawrence Taylor (L.T.) is featured in the game, reprising his role as Quentin Sands.
The game also alludes to real-life scandals involving NFL players, as former Washington Redhawks quarterback Mike Mexico is now serving time in prison. This situation is similar to that of Michael Vick, who used the pseudonym "Ron Mexico" when seeking treatment for herpes, as well as Vick's conviction for running an illegal dogfighting ring. There are also allegations of the New England Regulars cheating in a championship game, a reference to the New England Patriots' "Spygate" scandal. The game also features an incident with the Minnesota Reapers, reminiscent of the Minnesota Vikings boat scandal.
