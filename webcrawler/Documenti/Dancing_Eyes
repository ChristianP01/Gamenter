Titolo: Dancing Eyes

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Dancing Eyes is a 1996 puzzle arcade video game developed and published in Japan by Namco. It features gameplay reminiscent of arcade games like Qix â€” players control a monkey named Urusu-San as he must complete each level by destroying all of the tiles off the grid of a 3D object. Most levels revolve around the player slowly removing the clothing off of women, alongside destroying cobras, UFOs, and cardboard boxes. There are enemies that must be avoided, and there are also power-ups that grant different abilities. The game runs on the Namco System 11 hardware.
Created by Masateru Umeda, the designer for Namco's The Outfoxies, Dancing Eyes has gained notoriety for its sexual nature and comical design. Its characters were animated using motion capture, many of whom were voiced by well-known figures in the anime industry. Namco executives were skeptical of the game during production, as it broke away from the company's traditional family-friendly model. The game was openly disliked by publications in its initial release, who viewed it as "inappropriate" for arcades. Retrospectively, it has been praised for its quirky characters and fun gameplay, often being compared to games such as Qix or Gals Panic. A remake was announced for the PlayStation 3 under the Namco Generations series, but was cancelled.
