Titolo: Don't Look Back (video game)

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Don't Look Back is a platform game playable through Adobe Flash and designed by Terry Cavanagh. The game is a modern interpretation of the Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice.
The game is a combination of two ideas: Cavanagh wished to create a "silly shooter" where the player's actions were "redeemed" after being shown from a different perspective, and he also wished to create a game where the gameplay acted as a metaphor for the player's actions.
Critics praised the game's addictiveness and presentation, but had different opinions over its high difficulty level.
