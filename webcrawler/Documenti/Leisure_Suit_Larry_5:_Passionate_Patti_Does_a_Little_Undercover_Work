Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work is a graphical adventure game developed and published by Sierra On-Line for the Amiga, DOS and Macintosh computers in 1991. It is the fourth entry in their Leisure Suit Larry series and the first Larry title to have 256-color graphics and a fully icon-based interface. Being an (in)direct sequel to Leisure Suit Larry 3, its title is misleading, as there is no Leisure Suit Larry 4. It was re-released in 2017 on Steam with Windows support.
