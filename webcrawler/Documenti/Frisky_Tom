Titolo: Frisky Tom

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Frisky Tom is a 1981 arcade game by Nichibutsu. The object of the game is to provide enough water for a shower by crawling along a network of plumbing pipes and picking up/replacing loose pieces.  Various types of mice are the game's antagonists, trying to thwart Tom in different ways: knocking pipes loose to disrupt the water flow, jumping down to fall on him, or setting a bomb to blow up the entire plumbing arrangement. 
A Bandai Electronics VFD handheld version of Frisky Tom was released in 1982. A version for the Atari 5200 was programmed in 1983, but never published. Much later, ports of Frisky Tom were published  for the Nintendo Game Boy (in 1995)  then the PlayStation (in 2002).
