Titolo: I Made a Game with Zombies in It!

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: I Made a Game with Zombies in It! (officially stylized as I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MBIES 1N IT!!!1), is a zombie-themed action shoot 'em up game for the Xbox 360 video game console, available through the Xbox Live Indie Games service. Released in 2009, it was developed by Ska Studios and was designed entirely by company founder James Silva, previously best known for the Xbox Live Arcade game The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai. The game was developed using Microsoft XNA, though its tongue-in-cheek description claims it was made using "Hypermagic Engine 3.0 and the Megacore X parallelization processor." The game's title makes excessive comic usage of features of Internet writing, such as leetspeak, overuse of exclamation marks, and typographical errors.
