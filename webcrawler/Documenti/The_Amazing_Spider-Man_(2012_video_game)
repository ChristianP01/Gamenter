Titolo: The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: The Amazing Spider-Man is an open world action-adventure video game based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man and the 2012 film of the same name. It was developed by Beenox and published by Activision. It was released on June 26 in North America and on June 29, 2012 in Europe for Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Android, iOS, and Microsoft Windows. A version for the Wii U was released  in March 2013 in North America and Europe as The Amazing Spider-Man: Ultimate Edition in both regions. A PlayStation Vita version was also released in November 2013. A sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released in April 2014, loosely based on the film's sequel.
The game was directed by Gerard Lehiany and written by Seamus Kevin Fahey, Benjamin Schirtz and GÃ©rard Lehiany. Its story serves as an alternate epilogue to The Amazing Spider-Man film, which is continued in the game's sequel, implying that the games form an alternate version of the movies' universe. Months after the events of the film, a number of cross-species experiments created by Oscorp using Curt Connors' research escape into Manhattan and infect its population with a deadly virus, forcing Spider-Man to join forces with Gwen Stacy and Connors to find a cure. Meanwhile, the new Oscorp CEO, Alistair Smythe, attempts to develop his own cure so that he will be credited as the city's savior, and eliminate Spider-Man and Connors for interfering with his plans.
The Nintendo 3DS and Wii versions of the game also include the script and plot of the other versions of the game, but feature a much different, and more linear gameplay that doesn't have an open world environment, and instead features the player selecting a level from a hub, in this case, Stan's apartment, before playing a mostly linear level. It was natively designed for the 3DS and later ported to the Wii.
