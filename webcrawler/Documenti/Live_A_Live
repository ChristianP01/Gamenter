Titolo: Live A Live

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Live A Live is a 1994 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Famicom. The title remains exclusive to Japan, though it was given a fan translation by the online group Aeon Genesis. The game follows seven distinct scenarios scattered across different time periods, with two more unlockable scenarios linking the narratives together through the recurring antagonist Odio. Gameplay is split between exploration with story-specific twists, and turn-based combat played out on a grid.
Production began in late 1993, and was the directorial debut of Takashi Tokita. Tokita wanted to tell multiple stories within a single game, with each section drawing inspiration from different sources. Character designs for the seven main scenarios were handled by different manga artists. The music was composed by Yoko Shimomura as her first large-scale project after joining Square.
Reception of the game has been positive, with praise going to its unique gameplay and narrative mechanics, though its short length was faulted. Selling 270,000 units, the game was considered a failure. Tokita's work on Live A Live influenced his later projects, and he has voiced his willingness to remake the title if there were enough demand.
