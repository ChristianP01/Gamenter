Featuring original story material by Brian Michael Bendis, Marvel Super Heroes includes three plots and includes characters from both Marvel and Disney properties. The main campaign is divided into three stories. The first storyline follows the Avengers as they prevent the Norse God Loki from rebuilding the Casket of Ancient Winters. The second storyline centers on Spider-Man and features him, Nova, Iron Fist, and Nick Fury teaming with Venom and being tasked with the objective to stop Green Goblin and Mysterio's symbiote invasion. The third and final storyline concentrates around the Guardians of the Galaxy, in a plot heavily inspired by the movie with the same name, where the Guardians must protect Knowhere from Ronan the Accuser.
Disney Infinity 2.0 expands Disney Infinity's array of tools to use in the Toybox mode, an open world sandbox. Additionally, the ability to personalize individual characters has been added, using a Skill Tree. Marvel Super Heroes adds on the previous game's community sharing options, including the sharing of personal creations.
It was also the first Marvel-licensed game to be published by Disney Interactive Studios, due to Sega's contract with Marvel expiring after the release of Captain America: Super Soldier in 2011, and Activision's contract expiring after the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, released a few months prior to the release of Infinity 2.0. A sequel, Disney Infinity 3.0, was released on August 28, 2015 in Europe and August 29, 2015 in North America.
