Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Leaving Lyndow is a short first person adventure video game developed and published by Eastshade Studios. The game is the predecessor of the open-world adventure game Eastshade. While set in the same setting as the larger title, it features distinct game mechanics and story. The game was announced January 11, 2017, less than a month prior to its release on February 8, 2017. To avoid confusion with Eastshade, which was in development at the time, the developer released a short video explaining the reasoning and history behind the small titles' odd format and development.
