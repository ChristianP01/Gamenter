Titolo: The Last Bounty Hunter

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: The Last Bounty Hunter is a live-action laserdisc video game released by American Laser Games in 1994. Like almost all of the games produced by the now-defunct company, it is a rail shooter and, like the two installments in the Mad Dog McCree series before it, is set in the Old West. Filmed at Old Tucson Studios in Tucson, Arizona, it was one of the company's last releases before it was forced to close down. It was re-released by Digital Leisure in 2002 and was eventually packaged with Fast Draw Showdown by Global VR as an arcade cabinet under the name Six Gun Select.
Originally, home versions of the game were released to the MS-DOS, 3DO and CD-i. It has since been bundled with both Mad Dog McCree and Mad Dog II: The Lost Gold as part of 2009's Mad Dog McCree Gunslinger Pack, a compilation for the Wii.
