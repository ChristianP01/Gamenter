Titolo: Geist (video game)

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Geist (stylized as geist) is a first-person shooter action-adventure video game for the Nintendo GameCube, released on August 15, 2005, in North America; on October 7, 2005, in Europe; and on November 3, 2005, in Australia. The game was also supposed to be released in Japan, but was cancelled.
A prototype of the game was developed by n-Space, who approached Nintendo to be the game's publisher. Nintendo accepted, making Geist the second GameCube game published by Nintendo to receive an M-rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the first being Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem). In the following years, both companies worked closely on the project, with its first showing at E3 2003. Originally announced to be part of the GameCube's 2003 line-up, it was delayed multiple times, making it two years of delay for fine-tuning. During that time, the game's genre changed from the first-person shooter to first-person action-adventure with second-person elements.
Geist received mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game for its unique concepts, graphics, and story, while criticism was directed at its poor performance, sluggish controls, and bad animations.
