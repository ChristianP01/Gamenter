Titolo: Dragon Hopper

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Dragon Hopper is an unreleased action-adventure video game that was in development by Intelligent Systems and planned to be published by Nintendo on a scheduled 1996 release date exclusively for the Virtual Boy. Along with Japan System Supply's Bound High!, it would have been one of the first second-generation titles for the system if not for the poor critical and commercial reception it garnered that led to its planned relaunch being discontinued, which also led to the game's cancellation in the process.
Players control the young dragon prince Dorin as he embarks on a journey through the land of Faeron rescuing fairies and elemental spirits from enemy captivity in order to free his jailed loved ones and defeat a corrupt prime minister. Dragon Hopper was showcased on various trade shows and previewed in video game magazines but it was ultimately shelved due to the failure of the Virtual Boy itself, despite being completed for release.
