Titolo: Mashed

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Mashed is a vehicular combat racing video game developed by Supersonic Software. The game was originally released in Europe for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows in June 2004. An updated version with additional features, titled Mashed: Fully Loaded in Europe and Drive to Survive internationally, was released in Europe in March 2005 and in North America in December 2006. The direct sequel Wrecked: Revenge Revisited was released in 2012.
While the game allows four-player multiplayer, the PlayStation 2 only natively supported two controllers. Since the game used so few buttons, the PlayStation 2 version uniquely allows two people to share a controller - one player would use the D-pad and the left stick, the other would use the colored buttons and the right stick. The game supports the PS2 multi tap for four players.
