Titolo: Cliff Hanger (video game)

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Cliff Hanger is a laserdisc video game that was released by Stern Electronics in 1983. It is an interactive movie which requires the player to press a button or move the joystick in a particular direction when prompted by the game to progress the storyline.
The game uses animation from two Lupin III anime films, most prominently Hayao Miyazaki's The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), as well as The Mystery of Mamo (1978). The segments from The Mystery of Mamo use the original English dub commissioned by Toho, while the segments from The Castle of Cagliostro use a dub created for the game. A scene showing the protagonist being hanged after the player made a mistake was originally included, but an option was added to the game to turn it off.
