Titolo: Amazing Alex

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Amazing Alex was a physics-based puzzle game created by Rovio Entertainment, the developer of popular multiplatform strategy puzzle video game Angry Birds. Initially it was announced by Rovio's CEO Mikael Hed on Yle's breakfast television. The game was based on Casey's Contraptions, a game created by Noel Llopis (Snappy Touch) and Miguel √Ångel Friginal (Mystery Coconut), whose rights were acquired by Rovio. 
The game featured educational elements and revolved around the character Alex, described as a curious boy with interest in building things. The goal of the game was to make various Rube Goldberg-type chain reaction machines work. The game was very similar to The Incredible Machine, originally released in 1993.
On April 13, 2015, the game was removed from the App Store and Google Play.
