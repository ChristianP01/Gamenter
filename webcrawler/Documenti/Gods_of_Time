Titolo: Gods of Time

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Gods of Time was a free real-time 2D browser based MMORPG (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) with the goal of emulating downloadable MMORPGs, but with simpler graphics and a guest friendly system where players could play without creating an account until after they had finished playing. Unlike several other browser based games, Gods of Time didn't have a limit on play time, so players could play for as long as they wanted. At the time of the game's discontinuation, there were 5 classes: Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Hunter, and Thief.
