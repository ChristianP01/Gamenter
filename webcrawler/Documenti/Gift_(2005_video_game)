Descrizione: Gift (ギフト, Gifuto) is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Moonstone and released on May 27, 2005, for Windows. The original game was a collaboration project where the company Circus helped to produce it, though Moonstone did the majority of the work involved. Gift is Moonstone's fourth title, and was followed up with an adult fan disc called Gift Rainbow-colored Stories released on January 27, 2006, for Windows.
