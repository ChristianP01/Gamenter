Descrizione: Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA f (Japanese: 初音ミク -Project DIVA- f) is a 2012 rhythm game created by Sega and Crypton Future Media for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3. The game is the fifth entry in the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games and was released on the PlayStation Vita on August 30, 2012. A PlayStation 3 version titled Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F (Japanese: 初音ミク -Project DIVA- F) (capital F as opposed to the PS Vita's lowercase f) was released on March 7, 2013. The PS3 version was released physically and digitally in North America on August 27, 2013, making it the first game in the Project DIVA series to be released in the West. It was to be released in Europe at the same time, but instead released one week later, on September 4, 2013 as a digital download only title. The PS Vita version was released in North America and Europe in March 2014, both as digital download only titles as well.The game appeared at Sony's E3 2012 booth in June 2012 under the name Hatsune Miku so as to gauge interest for the game. Like the original the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software, and the songs created using these vocaloids, most notably the virtual-diva Hatsune Miku. Project DIVA F is the first game in the series to be multi-platform, with it being developed simultaneously for the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3, though there is some differences with regards to control schemes. A sequel, titled Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F 2nd, was released for PS3 and Vita on March 27, 2014 in Japan and released in November 2014 in North America and Europe.
