Titolo: Mass Effect 3: Leviathan

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Mass Effect 3: Leviathan is a downloadable content (DLC) pack developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for the 2012 action role-playing video game Mass Effect 3. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on August 28, 2012, with a delayed release in Europe on the PS3 platform set for August 29, 2012. The pack follows Commander Shepard and the crew of the SSV Normandy SR-2 starship as they investigate the truth about the origins of the Reapers.
Leviathan is the third major downloadable content pack for Mass Effect 3, after From Ashes and Extended Cut. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised the story and gameplay, but questioned the relevancy of the lore it added to the series' canon due to the controversy surrounding the ending of Mass Effect 3.
At the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards Leviathan was nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content), but ultimately lost to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Dawnguard.
