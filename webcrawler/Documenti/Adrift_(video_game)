Titolo: Adrift (video game)

Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Adrift (stylized as ADR1FT) is a first-person adventure video game developed by Three One Zero and published by 505 Games. It was released on March 28, 2016 for Microsoft Windows and July 15, 2016 for PlayStation 4. An Xbox One version of the game was planned but has been cancelled. The story follows an astronaut, who floats through the wreckage of a destroyed space station with no memory of the incident. Over the course of the game, players find clues that piece together the events of the incident, and attempt to repair the escape vehicle to return home.
Development began in 2013, following creator Adam Orth's resignation from Microsoft. The development team envision the game as a "first-person experience", purposefully avoiding violence. Orth compares the game to the upheaval in his life following his controversial comments about the Xbox One's DRM proposal.
