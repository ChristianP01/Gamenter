Titolo: College Football USA 96

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: College Football USA 96 is a sports game released in 1995 by EA Sports. It is the follow-up to Bill Walsh College Football '95 and part of EA's NCAA Football series of games.  College Football USA 96 was the first in the series to feature all Division l-A teams (108 at the time) as well as the first to feature real bowl games (Orange, Sugar, Fiesta, and Rose). With Bill Walsh's retirement from coaching after the 1994 season, the game no longer carried an endorsement.
The game received praise for the large number of available teams and for being an accurate simulation of the sport.
