Titolo: Plane Crazy (video game)

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Plane Crazy is an airplane combat/racing video game for Microsoft Windows and Sony PlayStation in which contestants pilot racing planes through 3D courses. Plane Crazy was based around arcade racers rather than flight simulation, focusing on action rather than realism. It was in fact originally planned for release in arcades as one of the first games to use Microsoft and Intel's Windows-based arcade system. The game supported the Heat.net (Windows) and Multiplay (PlayStation) multiplayer gaming system, with up to eight players allowed in one race.
