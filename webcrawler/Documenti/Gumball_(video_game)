Titolo: Gumball (video game)

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Gumball is a video game written for the Apple II by Veda Hlubinka-Cook (credited as Robert Cook) and published by Broderbund in 1983. It was ported to the Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. The player controls the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by color.
Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the machine-sorting concept and Cook added the gumball concept and built the core gameplay within a week. A secret image was found three decades after the game's release. Reviewers separately noted the difficulty of the game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work.
