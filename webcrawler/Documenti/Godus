Descrizione: Godus is a video game in the god game genre, developed by the independent company 22cans and published by DeNA. The company launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds and met their funding goal of GBÂ£450,000 (US$732,510) on 20 December 2012. Godus was designed by Peter Molyneux, who described it as the spiritual successor to his earlier creation, Populous. While the mobile versions of the game continue to be updated, the early access Steam release has yet to see an updated beta since 2016. The contract of the lead developer of the game, Konrad Naszynski, expired 28 June 2016, and it has been reported that there is no one left working on the PC version. As of December 2021, 7 years after the last update on the PC version, the game is still being advertised as early access.
