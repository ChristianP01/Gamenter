Descrizione: Arc the Lad is a tactical role-playing video game developed by G-Craft and published by Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively for the PlayStation. It was the best-selling Japanese PlayStation game of 1995 with over a million copies sold.
The story begins as the young girl Kukuru goes to put out the Flame Cion. At the same time, the hero Arc begins his quest to search for his estranged father, who left him and his mother 10 years ago. The two meet after Kukuru has put out the flame and is attacked by monsters.
Despite a heavy push for a North American release from RPG fans, the video game media, and third-party publishers, Arc the Lad was never formally released outside of Japan. However, years later it was included in the North American compilation Arc the Lad Collection.
