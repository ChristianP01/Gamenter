Titolo: Do You Like Horny Bunnies?

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Ecchi na Bani-san wa Kirai? (Japanese: エッチなバニーさんは嫌い?; "You don't hate Sexy Bunnies, Right?" localised as Do You Like Horny Bunnies?) is a bishōjo game developed by ZyX and released by G-Collections in 2001.
The game is a multi-scenario interactive eroge, although there is about five or ten minutes of clicking through dialogue before it becomes interactive. The main character is 18-year old Yukari Fujisawa, a feminine-looking Japanese boy who has never had sex with a girl. He starts working as a waiter in a membership restaurant, Platinum, where all the female employees wear Playboy bunny suits. Soon he finds out that the other waitresses, including his own cousin Sae Ishigami, have very unusual sexual tendencies.
The game features the original Japanese voices along with an English translation and is uncensored.
A sequel, Do You Like Horny Bunnies? 2,  which is set in another branch of Platinum with cameos from the original's characters, was also released in 2002.
