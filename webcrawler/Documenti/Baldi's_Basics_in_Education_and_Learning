Descrizione: Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning (also known as Baldi's Basics and Baldi's Basics Classic) is a 2018 American independent parody horror video game developed by Micah McGonigal, known by the pseudonym mystman12. The game parodies educational games of the 1990s through poor graphics and similar themes (such as Sonic's Schoolhouse, I.M. Meen, and 3D Dinosaur Adventure). Baldi's Basics was first released in beta on March 31, 2018 via Itch.io for Microsoft Windows and macOS. A full release of the game, including additional content and a story mode, was published in early access on June 12, 2020, with development ongoing.
