Titolo: Beyond: Two Souls

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Beyond: Two Souls is an interactive drama and action-adventure game for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Windows, developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was originally released on 8 October 2013 for the PlayStation 3, later being re-released for the PlayStation 4 on 24 November 2015. The game features Jodie Holmes, one of two player characters. The other is an incorporeal entity named Aiden: a separate soul linked to Jodie since birth. Jodie, who is portrayed by actor Elliot Page, possesses supernatural powers through her psychic link to Aiden, growing from adolescence to adulthood while learning to control Aiden and the powers they share. Willem Dafoe co-stars as Nathan Dawkins, a researcher in the Department of Paranormal Activity and Jodie's surrogate-father-figure. The actors in the game worked during the year-long project in Quantic Dream's Paris studio to perform on-set voice acting and motion-capture acting.
Despite being a video game, Beyond: Two Souls premiered at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, marking only the second time the film festival recognised a video game. David Cage, writer and director of the game, explained that game development studios should provide "interactive storytelling" that can be played by everyone, including non-gamers. The game received polarised critical reception upon its release. Sales reached over one million copies two months after its worldwide release by the end of 2013. Two years later, a PlayStation 4 version was released, both as a standalone game and then in the Quantic Dream Collection with the 2010 game Heavy Rain. A version for Windows was released on 22 July 2019.
