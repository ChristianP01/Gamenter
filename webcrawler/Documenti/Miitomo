Descrizione: Miitomo is a discontinued freemium social networking mobile app developed by Nintendo for iOS and Android devices.

The app was released in March 2016 for iOS and two months later for Android, launching alongside their My Nintendo service. Despite initially being a critical and commercial success, with over ten million downloads worldwide a month after release, its popularity dwindled soon after and it was ultimately discontinued on May 9, 2018 after an incident in everywhere where minors were sharing Friend Codes with strangers who had exploited the messaging service to allegedly exchange pornographic imagery.
