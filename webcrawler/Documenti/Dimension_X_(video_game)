Titolo: Dimension X (video game)

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Dimension X is a first person action game for the Atari 8-bit family released in 1984 by Synapse Software. It was designed by Steve Hales, who previously wrote Slime and Fort Apocalypse for Synapse. Dimension X is a vehicle-based, first person shooter with similar gameplay to Atari's Battlezone and Novagen's Encounter (the latter of which was distributed in the US by Synapse). The manual includes instructions for a Commodore 64 version of the game, but it was never completed nor released.The game was advertised far in advance of its release. Magazine ads emphasized features which did not exist or were not as impressive in the final game which contributed to a negative reception.
