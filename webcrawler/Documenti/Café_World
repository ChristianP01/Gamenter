Available on Facebook, players strive to become master chefs and build a food empire by completing catering orders.
In celebration of the first anniversary, players were challenged to complete a “One Year Anniversary Party” order with five new cookbook recipes. Players who successfully completed the order were entered for a chance to win a trip for two to New York City.Following the Japan earthquake in March 2011, Zynga re-released several Japanese-themed decorations to Café World in order to benefit Japan's Save the Children Earthquake Emergency Fund.To celebrate the second anniversary, players were challenged to complete a goal series to prepare a feast for British Royals. Players who successfully completed the goal series were entered for a chance to win a trip to Britain.In 2012, the game attracted approximately 2.6 million monthly active users. It was a freemium game, meaning there is no cost to play, but players have the option of purchasing premium content.
Zynga announced on 23 May 2014 that it would be closing the game on 22 July 2014. On July 23, 2014, Café World was completely removed from Facebook.
