Descrizione: Chameleon Twist (カメレオンツイスト, Kamereon Tsuisuto) is a platform game developed by Japan System Supply and published for the Nintendo 64 in 1997 by Sunsoft.
Though disliked by critics due to its easy gameplay, repetitive music, and awkward camera angles, Chameleon Twist was followed by a sequel titled Chameleon Twist 2.
This 3D platform game has players take on the role of one of four anthropomorphic chameleons, and travel across six themed worlds. The chameleon's elongated tongue can be used as a weapon, a means to traverse gaps, or as a way to leap onto platforms. Once the tongue is unrolled, it can be guided in any direction using the analog stick. A five-room training area lets players practice the controls. The single-player game involves progressing through predominately indoor environments, each culminating in a boss battle, while collecting hearts to replenish health.
