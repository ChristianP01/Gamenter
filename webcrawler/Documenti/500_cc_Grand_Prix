Titolo: 500 cc Grand Prix

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: 500cc Grand Prix was one of the first French-made games for the Atari ST. It was developed by Micro√Øds in 1987. The graphics and animation were not well developed in this motorcycle racing game but on the other hand the fact that the game has a versus mode is well-appreciated.
