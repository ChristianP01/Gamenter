Titolo: Airstrike (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Airstrike is a horizontally scrolling shooter written by Steven A. Riding for the Atari 8-bit family. Having strong similarities to Konami's 1981 Scramble arcade game, it was published in 1982 as the first release from UK-based English Software. The company proclaimed the game "Very, very, difficult!" in magazine advertisements, and reviewers agreed with that assessment.
Airstrike was followed by Airstrike II, also programmed by Riding, in 1983.
