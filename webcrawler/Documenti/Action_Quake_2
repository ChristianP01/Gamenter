Titolo: Action Quake 2

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Action Quake 2 is a mod for the video game Quake II created by The A-Team. Action Quake 2 was developed to recreate the look and feel of an action movie, having a fast pace and a semi-realistic damage system. It features many maps recreating realistic settings, such as city streets and office buildings, with a balanced range of weapons and equipment inspired by action movies.
Action Quake 2 is essentially a version of deathmatch and team deathmatch in which most of the classic elements have been modified to some degree. Damage to extremities such as a shot to the leg with any weapon will cause damage and bleeding, along with crippling the player's movement until they bandage themselves.  Originally released in 1998, there was still an active community of players as of 2015.
