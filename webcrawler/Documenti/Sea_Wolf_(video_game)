Titolo: Sea Wolf (video game)

Anno: 1976

Descrizione: Sea Wolf is a shooter video game manufactured by Midway, originally released for arcades in 1976. It is a video game update of an earlier coin-operated electro-mechanical Midway game, Sea Devil, itself based on Sega's 1966 coin-op electro-mechanical arcade submarine simulator Periscope. The game was released in Japan by Taito. Sea Wolf was designed by Dave Nutting. The game sold 10,000 arcade cabinets, and was the highest-grossing arcade video game of 1976 and 1977 in the United States, and Japan's fifth highest-grossing arcade video game of 1976.
Midway released a color arcade sequel, Sea Wolf II, in 1978. In 1982, Commodore International produced cartridge ports of Sea Wolf for the VIC-20 and then-new Commodore 64 computers.
