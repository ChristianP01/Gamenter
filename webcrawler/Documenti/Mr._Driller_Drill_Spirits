Titolo: Mr. Driller Drill Spirits

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Mr. Driller Drill Spirits is a 2004 puzzle video game developed and published by Namco for the Nintendo DS. Controlling one of six characters, the player must make it to the bottom of each stage by destroying, colored formations of blocks while preventing their oxygen meter from depleting. Multiple different gamemodes are present, including a single-player campaign, a time-attack mode, and a competitive multiplayer mode. It is the sixth entry in the Mr. Driller series.
Originally known as New Mister Driller and later Mr. Driller DS, Drill Spirits was first shown at the E3 2004 tradeshow during a showcasing of third-party games in development for the Nintendo DS. It was produced by series creator Hideo Yoshizawa, and was created to take advantage of the system's touch control and dual-screen features. The game was announced as a launch title for the system, alongside Namco's own Ridge Racer DS. The North American version excludes several features announced prior in press releases due to time constraints, including an entire gamemode called Dristone Driller. Drill Spirits received mixed reviews for its lack of depth and multiplayer modes requiring two game cards to play, although its gameplay, visuals and modes were the subject of praise. It was followed by Mr. Driller Online in 2008.
