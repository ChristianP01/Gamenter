Titolo: Triple Hunt

Anno: 1977

Descrizione: Triple Hunt is a  shooter-style arcade game developed by Atari and released in April 1977. Triple Hunt's main feature is its mounted light gun, which is used to shoot at the screen on a separate cabinet. Each Triple Hunt unit houses three changeable games; Witch Hunt, Hit The Bear, and Raccoon Hunt. The game graphics are displayed over the background graphics, and when a monitor mask is placed on the screen, the graphics 'disappear' behind the mask. Since the gun is light operated, the shots would not go through the mask, and did not count.  It was first introduced at the Third Annual Distributor Meeting banquet on March 22, 1977.
