Titolo: P-47: The Phantom Fighter

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: P-47: The Phantom Fighter is a 1988 horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game originally developed by NMK and published by Jaleco. Set during World War II, players control a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft to face against the Nazis, who are occupying multiple countries around the world. Its gameplay involves destroying waves of enemies, picking up power-ups and new weapons, and destroying bosses. It ran on the Mega System 1 hardware.
P-47: The Phantom Fighter was created by NMK as a game that celebrated the fight for freedom instead of war, with composer Sizlla Okamura not wanting the music being about horrors of war and leaned towards the concept of freedom being fun instead. First launched in arcades, the game was later ported to other platforms and has since been re-released through download services for modern platforms. A conversion for the Sega Mega Drive was in development, however it did not receive an official release to the public. The title was met with mostly positive reception from critics and players alike, earning an award from Gamest magazine, however the home ports garnered mixed response from magazines, many of which also drew comparison with Silkworm. A sequel, P-47 Aces, was released in 1995.
