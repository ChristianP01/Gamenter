Titolo: Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition is a 1992 golf video game developed by Sculptured Software and published by Accolade for MS-DOS. It is part of a series of games named after golfer Jack Nicklaus, and follows Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design (1990). Like its predecessor, the game includes a golf course designer that allows the player to create customized courses. Two add-on disks provide additional courses. In 1995, both disks were re-released along with Signature Edition as a compilation titled Jack Nicklaus: The Tour Collection.
Jack Nicklaus' Power Challenge Golf, a scaled-down version of Signature Edition that lacks a course designer, was released for the Sega Genesis in July 1993. Both versions were praised for their graphics. The game was followed by Jack Nicklaus 4 (1997).
