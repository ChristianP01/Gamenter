Titolo: FusionFall

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall was a massively multiplayer online game developed by Cartoon Network and South Korean studio Grigon Entertainment. FusionFall used the Unity engine as its client technology basis.
For the first year, the full game required a subscription; free accounts could only access a portion of the content. On August 29, 2013, the game's servers were shut down. It was unofficially revived by fans as two different games in 2017, the first being FusionFall: Retro which was the original game and the second being FusionFall: Legacy which was the original game but with additional content. In April 15, 2020, Cartoon Network issued a DMCA takedown notice to the developers of the games, resulting in Retro being removed entirely and Legacy being cancelled.
