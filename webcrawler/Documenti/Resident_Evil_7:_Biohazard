Titolo: Resident Evil 7: Biohazard

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Resident Evil 7: Biohazard is a 2017 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. A major installment in the Resident Evil series, the player controls Ethan Winters as he searches for his long-missing wife in a derelict plantation occupied by an infected family, solving puzzles and fighting enemies. Resident Evil 7 diverges from the more action-oriented Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, returning to the franchise's survival horror roots, emphasizing exploration.  It is the first main series game to use a first-person view.
Resident Evil 7 is the first full-length game to use Capcom's in-house RE Engine. The development was led by Koshi Nakanishi, director of the 2012 Nintendo 3DS game Resident Evil: Revelations. A year prior to its announcement at E3 2016, it was presented as a virtual reality demo called Kitchen. The team took inspiration from the 1981 film The Evil Dead, scaled back the game to one location, and used a first-person perspective to immerse players. Two downloadable content scenarios were released, Not a Hero and End of Zoe.
Resident Evil 7 was released in January 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and in May 2018 for the Nintendo Switch in Japan. It also supports the PlayStation VR headset. The game was considered a return to form for the series; critics praised the gameplay, innovation, and uses of virtual reality, but the boss battles and final chapter received more mixed reception. As of October 2021, the game has sold 10 million copies worldwide. It was nominated for several end-of-year accolades. A sequel, Resident Evil Village, was released on May 7, 2021.
