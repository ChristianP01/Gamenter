Titolo: Starhawk (1979 video game)

Anno: 1979

Descrizione: Starhawk is a 1979 vector arcade game designed and programmed by Tim Skelly and manufactured by Cinematronics. Starhawk is a shoot 'em up unofficially based on the Star Wars: Episode IV trench run, the first arcade game to blatantly use concepts from Star Wars. The game was unique at the time for its pseudo-3D graphics. It was distributed in Japan by Sega, and was later ported for the Vectrex home system in 1982.
The arcade cabinet had a cinder block placed inside of it, to prevent it from tipping onto the player.
