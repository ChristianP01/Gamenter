Titolo: The Sentinel (video game)

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: The Sentinel, released in the United States as The Sentry, is a puzzle video game created by Geoff Crammond, published by Firebird in 1986 for the BBC Micro and converted to the Commodore 64 (by Crammond himself), Amstrad CPC (with a cross-compiler written by Crammond), ZX Spectrum (by Mike Follin), Atari ST, Amiga (both by Steve Bak) and IBM PC compatibles (by Mark Roll). The Sentinel was among the first games to use solid-filled 3D graphics on home computers. It won numerous awards upon release and has since appeared on several "best video games of all time" lists.
The IBM PC port supports VGA graphics, with an additional lighting effect: objects and terrain becomes darker the farther away they are from the point of view. The Amiga port has a sampled soundtrack by David Whittaker.
