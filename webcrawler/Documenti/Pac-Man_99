Descrizione: Pac-Man 99 is a maze video game with battle royale elements developed by Arika and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for the Nintendo Switch. It was released through the Nintendo Switch Online service on April 7, 2021.
Part of its Pac-Man franchise, its gameplay involves up to 99 players competing simultaneously, similar to Tetris 99. Players control Pac-Man through an enclosed maze, eating dots on the board and avoiding colored ghosts that pursue them. Eating power pellets causes the ghosts to turn blue and become edible; eating ghosts sends enemies called "Jammer Pac-Man" to another opponent in an attempt to slow them down and eliminate them from the game. The game features paid downloadable content that includes offline play and additional skins, with some based on other Namco games.
