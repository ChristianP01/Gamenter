Titolo: Food Force

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Food Force is an educational game published by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in 2005. Due to its content, it is considered a serious game (game with educational purpose).  Players take on missions to distribute food in a famine-affected country and to help it to recover and become self-sufficient again. At the same time they learn about hunger in the real world and the WFP's work to prevent it.
In 2011, a new, socially interactive game was launched in November by the World Food Programme in partnership with Konami. The game, which takes place entirely on Facebook, is amongst the first games ever to feature a real world impact through virtual goods.
