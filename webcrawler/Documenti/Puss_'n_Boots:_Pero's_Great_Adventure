Titolo: Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure is a video game released in 1990 by Electro Brain for the NES. There was a Japan-only prequel called Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Isshū 80 Nichi Dai Bōken (長靴をはいた猫 世界一周８０日大冒険). It was loosely based on Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. Pero's name is also "Perrault" in the Japanese game. The character Pero, who is Toei Animation's mascot, is based on the cat from the folktale entitled "Puss in Boots" by Charles Perrault. The game's title comes from that story as well.
