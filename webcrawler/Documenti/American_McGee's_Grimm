Titolo: American McGee's Grimm

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: American McGee's Grimm is a 23-part episodic video game series based upon Grimm's Fairy Tales, designed by American McGee, developed by Spicy Horse and distributed online initially by GameTap starting July 31, 2008. Grimm was originally thought to resemble the warped fairy tale style of American McGee's Alice, but the art style appears to be much more child-friendly and simplistic. Grimm is written and executive-produced by the same person as American McGee's Alice, R. J. Berg. The original announcement was made in the June 2007 issue of PC Gamer.
Spicy Horse Games is using Unreal Engine 3 technology for American McGee's Grimm.There are 23 weekly episodes, divided into three seasons of eight or seven episodes each.  Each episode offers approximately a half an hour of gameplay, although different playing styles (either for "complete conversion" or "speed-runs") make for different times.  The game has been referred to as "highly accessible" and American McGee has commented that the game experience shares a similarity with Katamari Damacy.A five-issue comic book mini-series based on the game began in April 2009. Published by IDW Publishing, the book was written by Dwight L. MacPherson with art by Grant Bond.
