Titolo: Costume Quest

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Costume Quest is a party-based role-playing video game developed by Double Fine Productions and published by THQ on October 19, 2010. In the game, the player controls a kid that is trick-or-treating with their twin on Halloween night when they encounter a monster that kidnaps their sibling. The player must travel around the local neighborhood collecting items for their costume, candy and fellow children as companions in order to face the leader of the monsters and rescue their sibling. The costume aspects are used in turn-based battle segments, where the player character and companions are transformed into whatever they are dressed as to fight other monsters; the costume aspects are also used for abilities outside of battles.
A DLC expansion titled "Grubbins on Ice", was released on December 21, 2010, taking place after the events of the original game and in an entirely new setting: the monster world of Repugia. A sequel, Costume Quest 2, was released in 2014.
