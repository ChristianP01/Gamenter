Titolo: Codebreaker (video game)

Anno: 1978

Descrizione: Codebreaker is a video game released in 1978 by Atari, Inc. for the Atari VCS (later renamed the Atari 2600). It was in the first wave of Atari VCS games to follow the original nine launch titles. It was one of three cartridges to accompany the introduction of the Atari keyboard controller, an add-on launched in response to claims of false advertising that the VCS is a "computer" (the other two were Hunt & Score and Brain Games).The cover art for the game is by Chris Spohn, who created the cover art for many early Atari games.
