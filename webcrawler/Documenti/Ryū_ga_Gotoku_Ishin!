Titolo: Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin! (Japanese: 龍が如く 維新!, lit. "Like a Dragon: Restoration!") is a spin-off game in the Ryū ga Gotoku video game series, known in English localization as Yakuza. It was produced by Sega and released the for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, serving as a Japanese launch title for the latter platform.
Set in the chaotic Bakumatsu period between 1853 and 1867, Sakamoto Ryōma is distressed resulting from conflicting pressures and uncertainty about one's self and role in the society. Being embroiled in the middle of a Tosa coup d'état and bent on finding the murderer who assassinated his mentor, Ryoma burrows himself with a hidden identity in the streets of Kyoto and joins the grim Shinsengumi.
Despite being the second Ryū ga Gotoku series spin-off set in the samurai era instead of modern-day Japan, this game is unrelated to Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan!, which was released in 2008 on the PlayStation 3. Kenzan! is set two centuries before Ishin!, hence the plots are not related with each other. Each game focuses on a different character, the historical figures of Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645) and Sakamoto Ryōma (1836-1867) respectively.
