Titolo: Death Tank

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Death Tank is a 1996 competitive multiplayer, 2D artillery game developed by Ezra Dreisbach of Lobotomy Software. Influenced by Scorched Earth, the gameplay is real-time instead of turn-based. It supports two to seven players, represented by differently-colored tanks, with a range of weapons. The terrain on which this occurs is heavily deformed during play.
The original Death Tank was a hidden bonus game in the Sega Saturn port of PowerSlave (1996). An update, Death Tank Zwei, was hidden in the Saturn version of Duke Nukem 3D (1997).
In a 1996 interview Lobotomy Software co-founder Brian McNeely said that Dreisbach "threw [Death Tank] together in his spare time. We play it every day, religiously." The title screen shows the red and blue tanks because these were the colors favored by Dreisbach and Jeff Blazier, who had an ongoing rivalry in the game.
