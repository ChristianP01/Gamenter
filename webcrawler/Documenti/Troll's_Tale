It uses the same engine for Sunnysoft's earlier game Dragon's Keep. Sierra acquired the game from Sunnysoft, along with Dragon's Keep and Bop-A-Bet by April 1983 and appointed Nancy Anderton to manage the publishing of their educational games. Peter Oliphant converted the games for the Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64 and, as a self-booting disk, IBM PC compatibles. Coleco made a deal with Sierra planning to release the game on ColecoVision with a Super Game Module. The game came packaged with a paper map, showing an incomplete layout of the game and stickers to mark the treasure locations.
