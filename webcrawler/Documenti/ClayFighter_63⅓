Titolo: ClayFighter 63⅓

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: ClayFighter 63⅓ is a 1997 fighting game developed and published by Interplay Productions for the Nintendo 64. It is the third installment of the ClayFighter series. The title is a parody of the "64" suffix common with the Nintendo 64's games.
Upon release, ClayFighter 63⅓ was negatively received by critics for its gameplay, animation, and AI. An updated version entitled ClayFighter: Sculptor's Cut was released in 1998 as a Blockbuster rental exclusive. Due to not receiving wide distribution, Sculptor's Cut is one of the rarest and most valuable Nintendo 64 games.
