Titolo: Sonic Runners

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Sonic Runners was a 2015 endless runner game in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise for Android and iOS. It was developed by Sonic Team as its first Sonic game exclusive to smartphones and published by Sega. In Sonic Runners, the player-character constantly ran forward, and players controlled their jumping from a side-scrolling perspective using the touchscreen. The game was free-to-play, featured a wide variety of playable characters from the Sonic series, and received periodic updates.
Development began in late 2013 and lasted a year and a half. Sonic Team sought to take advantage of the uses of smartphones and built the game using the Unity game engine. They designed Sonic Runners to have more replay value than other endless running games. The game was soft launched in select regions in February 2015 before its full release the following June. It failed commercially and received mixed reviews; although critics praised its gameplay, they criticized the pop-up ads, pay-to-play elements, and technical problems. Sega discontinued the game in July 2016, though Gameloft released a replacement game, Sonic Runners Adventure, in 2017.
