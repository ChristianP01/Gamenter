Descrizione: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released in the United States as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) is an action-adventure video game based on the 2001 film of the same name. Philosopher's Stone was initially released for the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color, Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in November 2001. A different game bearing the same name was made two years later for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox in December 2003. The versions on different platforms differ greatly from each other and do not follow the same level structures or gameplay.
The story follows protagonist Harry Potter, who, after discovering he is a wizard, is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he makes friends and receives magical training, and along with his friends stop Lord Voldemort from returning to power. The game received mixed reviews. Critics commented on the game's accessible gameplay and its unimpressive graphics (2003 versions) while others said the game's license would be the only thing to draw in fans.
