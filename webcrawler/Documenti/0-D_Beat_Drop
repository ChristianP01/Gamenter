With elements of Puyo Puyo and Lumines, the game has players organizing colored shapes onto a playing field in order to match three pieces and clear them using the game's titular Beat Drop, which requires the player to listen to the techno soundtrack. It also sponsored a Japanese K-pop band Sweat Vacation and the difficulty for this game was added based on it.
