Descrizione: Track Attack (stylized as Track Attack!) is a train-themed action game written by Chris Jochumson for the Apple II. It was published in 1982 by Broderbund, as was an Atari 8-bit family port by Bill Hooper. Track Attack contains both overhead maze levels and side-scrolling platform game levels. In the latter, the player controls a character who runs along the top of a train, performing acrobatic leaps between the cars. Jochumson co-authored The Arcade Machine which was released the same year.
