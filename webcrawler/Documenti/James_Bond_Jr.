Titolo: James Bond Jr.

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: James Bond Jr. is a character described as the nephew of Ian Fleming's spy James Bond. The name was first used in a 1967 spinoff novel, The Adventures of James Bond Junior 003Â½, authored by the never clarified pseudonym R. D. Mascott but widely speculated to be Arthur Calder-Marshall. The idea was used again in 1991 in an American animated series starring Bond Jr. The series was mildly successful, spawning a six-volume novelization series by John Peel (writing as John Vincent), a comic book series by Marvel Comics published in 1992, and video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES.
