Titolo: Smash TV

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Smash TV is a 1990 arcade game created by Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell for Williams Electronics Games. It is a dual-stick shooter (one for moving, avoiding enemies and collecting prizes, and the other for firing) in the same vein as 1982's Robotron: 2084 (co-created by Jarvis). The Super NES, Genesis, Master System, and Game Gear versions were titled Super Smash TV.
The plot centers on a dystopian television show during the then-future year of 1999, where one or two "lucky" contestants must shoot their way to fame and fortune; the show is taped in front of a live studio audience with broadcast via satellite worldwide. The goal of the game show is to kill or be killed, and once all of the challengers in each arena have been massacred, the contestant(s) will proceed to survive the next gauntlet.
