Set two hundred years after Mega Man Zero 4, ZX introduces a new open-ended gameplay environment and features the ability to select the protagonist's gender, a first in the Mega Man series. The game's plot revolves around the efforts of the protagonist and a peacekeeping organization known as the Guardians to recover powerful ancient artifacts, the Biometals, from the Pseudoroids, evil robots made to harness their power, and stop their creator.

The game was re-released in February 2020 as part of the Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Microsoft Windows.
