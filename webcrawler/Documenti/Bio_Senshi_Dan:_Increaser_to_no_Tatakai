Descrizione: Bio-Senshi Dan: Increaser to no Tatakai is a 1987 action-adventure game that was released exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom.
Initially, there were plans to bring the game to the English market under the title Bashi Bazook: Morphoid Masher. Initial plans to bring this version to the English market fell through due to the game's similarity to Xexyz. However, English-translated ROMs of the game later became widely circulated on the Internet.
