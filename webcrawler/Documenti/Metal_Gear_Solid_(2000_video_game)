Descrizione: Metal Gear Solid, released in Japan as Metal Gear: Ghost Babel, is a 2000 action-adventure stealth video game produced by Konami for the Game Boy Color. It was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Japan after they were commissioned by Konami's European branch to develop a portable adaptation of their 1998 PlayStation game of the same title. However, the story of the Game Boy Color version is not a direct adaptation of the original PlayStation version, nor is it set in the mainline continuity, but instead it takes place in an alternative continuity set seven years after the events of the original Metal Gear (1987).
