Descrizione: Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is a 2012 Lego-themed action-adventure, platform video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The game is a standalone sequel to Lego Batman: The Videogame and the second installment in the Lego Batman series. The game's main storyline follows Batman, Robin and later Superman as they attempt to foil the Joker and Lex Luthor's plans to have the latter become president of the United States, joining forces with the Justice League along the way.
