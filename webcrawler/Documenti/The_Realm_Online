Descrizione: The Realm Online, originally known as The Realm, is a massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) launched in December 1996 for Windows PC. It was designed in the tradition of graphical MUDs, before the usage of the terms "massively multiplayer" and "MMORPG".Originally published by Sierra On-Line, it was abandoned by that company because of its unfavorable comparison to Ultima Online and EverQuest. It was next taken up for a short time by a company called World Opponent Network which was also owned by Sierra On-line, then Codemasters, and presently is a Norseman Games production.In April 2018 Norseman Games of Michigan, LLC granted an exclusive license to Rat Labs, LLC to develop and distribute The Realm. Later in June 1, Rat Labs opened a "fresh start" server that is free to play.
