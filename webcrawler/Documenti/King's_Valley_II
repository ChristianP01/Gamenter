Titolo: King's Valley II

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: King's Valley II: The Seal of El Giza is a game for MSX1 and MSX2 computers by Konami. It is a sequel to King's Valley from 1985.
The MSX2 version only saw a release in Japan. The same goes for a very rare "contest" version. The contest was about making levels with the games' built-in level editor, held by four Japanese MSX magazines, two of them are MSX.FAN and Beep. The winners of this contest received a gold cartridge with the twenty custom stages on it. Custom levels can be saved to either a disk or tape, and the levels are interchangeable between both the MSX1 and MSX2 versions.
