Titolo: Hunter: The Reckoning – Wayward

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Hunter: The Reckoning – Wayward is a 2003 hack-and-slash video game developed by High Voltage Software and published by Vivendi Universal Games for the PlayStation 2. It is based on the tabletop role-playing game Hunter: The Reckoning, and is part of the larger World of Darkness series. It is a sequel to the 2002 video game Hunter: The Reckoning, and was followed by Redeemer in 2003.
Players control hunters, progressing through missions and areas non-linearly while fighting enemies with physical and magical attacks. The story is set two years after the previous game, and sees the hunters returning to the town of Ashcroft following the appearance of a witch's cult and supernatural beings.
The game was announced in early 2003 as a port of the previous Hunter: The Reckoning game, but with a new story, and with gameplay changes made based on player feedback. It was released to "mixed or average" reception, with reviewers frequently criticizing how the game's multiplayer mode only supports two concurrent players, compared to the previous game's four, but praising the controls and gameplay improvements.
