Descrizione: Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano, known in Europe as SCAR - Squadra Corse Alfa Romeo (SCAR - Alfa Romeo Racing Team), is a racing video game for the PlayStation 2, Windows and Xbox. It was developed by Milestone srl and released in 2005.
All the cars in the game are manufactured by the Alfa Romeo motor company. While most of the tracks are in Italy, a few are in other countries like Germany and the United States. A distinguishing feature of the game is that it models driver development using a system almost identical to a role-playing video game. In addition, cars get damaged, both visibly and in performance, by collisions or by driving off course.
