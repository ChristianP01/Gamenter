Descrizione: DropMix is a music mixing game developed by Harmonix and published by Hasbro. The game uses a mix of physical cards with chips embedded with near field communication, a specialized electronic game board with NFC and Bluetooth capabilities, and a companion application for mobile devices (iOS or Android) that communicates with the board via Bluetooth. By playing a card, representing a specific song, atop a proper board space, the board will detect its NFC code and relay that to the app, which will play a sample from that song, such as a drum loop or a vocal section. With multiple cards on the board, the app will manage how all the current songs are mixed as played through the app, creating a mashup. The game has several game modes for single and multi-player play, and additional cards, featuring more song samples, can be purchased as booster packs.
