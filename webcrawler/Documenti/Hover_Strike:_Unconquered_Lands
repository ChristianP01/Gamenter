Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Hover Strike: Unconquered Lands is a shooter video game developed and published by Atari Corporation exclusively for the Atari Jaguar CD in North America and Europe on October 23, 1995. A remake of Hover Strike for the Atari Jaguar, it was created by most of the original team who worked on the original game and both titles share the same overall plot, where the Terrakian alien race seized control of a colonized foreign planet and players are tasked with piloting an armed hovercraft vehicle in an attempt of rescuing the captured colonists and destroy the invading forces from the planet's surface before the Federation armada arrives.
As with the original game, Hover Strike: Unconquered Lands received mixed reception from critics after its initial release and many felt divided in regards to multiple aspects of the game such as the presentation, visuals, sound and gameplay.
