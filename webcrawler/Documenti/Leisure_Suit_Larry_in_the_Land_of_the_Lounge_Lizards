Titolo: Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is a graphic adventure game, developed by Sierra On-Line and published in 1987. It was developed for the PC DOS and the Apple II and later ported to other platforms such as the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, Apple Macintosh, and the Tandy Color Computer 3. It utilizes the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) engine. In 1991, Sierra released a remake version titled Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards that used the Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine with 256 colors and a point-and-click, icon-driven (as opposed to the original's text-based) user interface, released for the PC DOS, Apple Macintosh, and Amiga.
The game's story follows its player character of a middle-aged male virgin named Larry Laffer as he desperately tries to "get lucky" in the fictional American city of Lost Wages. Land of the Lounge Lizards establishes several elements which recur in the later Leisure Suit Larry games, including Larry's campy attire, perpetual bad luck with women, and penchant for double-entendres. The game's overall plot and basic structure follow that of Softporn Adventure, Sierra's own 1981 Apple II text adventure that did not feature Larry.
Despite a lack of advertising, the game was a sleeper hit and a commercial and critical success. It was followed by a long series of sequels and spin-offs over decades, beginning with Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places) in 1988. A second, high-definition remake, titled Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded, was developed by N-Fusion Interactive working with the Larry series' creator Al Lowe and published by Replay Games in 2013.
