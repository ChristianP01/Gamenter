Originally conceived as an adventure game named Dream for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Banjo-Kazooie was designed to appeal to players of all ages in a similar vein to Walt Disney Animation Studios films. The game was a critical and commercial success, selling nearly two million copies in the United States. It was praised for its detailed graphics, dynamic soundtrack, and intricate level design, with many reviews comparing it favorably to Super Mario 64. In 1999, it received two awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences: Console Action Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics.
Banjo-Kazooie was followed by a sequel, Banjo-Tooie, in 2000. The game was remastered for the Xbox 360 in 2008 and included in the Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One in 2015. It was added to the Nintendo Switch Online library of Nintendo 64 games on 20 January 2022, marking its first re-release on a Nintendo console.
