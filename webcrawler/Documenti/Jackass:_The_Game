Titolo: Jackass: The Game

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Jackass: The Game is a party video game based on the television series Jackass. It was developed by Sidhe for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, while the Nintendo DS version was developed by Sensory Sweep Studios. The game was published by Red Mile Entertainment.
All of the Jackass cast (excluding Bam Margera, who did not appear in the game due to contractual commitments with Activision) and crew provided their own voices and supply their likenesses for the game. The game uses motion capture to replicate the cast's movements. However, Ryan Dunn did not participate in the filming of the motion capture due to him being diagnosed with depression because of a blood clot. He does, however, voice his in-game character. Johnny Knoxville and other members of the Jackass team also provided stunt ideas to the developers based on unused stunts from the show.
