Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Allegiance is a multiplayer online game initially developed by Microsoft Research. It is notable for providing a mix of real-time strategy and player piloted space combat gameplay.
Although the game was well received upon release, its sales turned out disappointing, selling fewer than 29,000 copies in its first year.
