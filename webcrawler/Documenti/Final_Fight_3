Titolo: Final Fight 3

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Final Fight 3, released in Japan as Final Fight Tough (Japanese: ファイナルファイト タフ, Hepburn: Fainaru Faito Tafu), is a side-scrolling beat 'em up by Capcom originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995. It is the second sequel to Final Fight released for the Super NES, following Final Fight 2, and like its predecessor, it was produced by Capcom's consumer division with no preceding arcade version released.
The game features the return of the protagonist Guy along with Haggar and also introduces new characters Lucia and Dean. The game's plot takes them through their efforts to rid Metro City of the new Skull Cross gang. Final Fight 3 introduced new moves, as well as branching paths during gameplay and multiple endings. Also available is the option to fight alongside a CPU-controlled partner. However, most critics felt these changes did too little in the way of expanding and improving upon the original Final Fight, and the game was released to little fanfare.
The next Final Fight game released, Final Fight Revenge, eschewed the side-scrolling beat'em up gameplay in favor of a one-on-one 3D fighting game format.
