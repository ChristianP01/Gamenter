Descrizione: Liquid Kids is a 1990 platform arcade video game originally developed and published by Taito. Starring the platypus Hipopo, players are tasked with travelling through the land of Woody-Lake throwing water bombs, jumping on and off platforms to navigate level obstacles while dodging and defeating monsters in order to rescue Tamasun from her captor, the Fire Demon. Although first launched in arcades, the game was later ported to other platforms, each one featuring several changes compared with the original version, in addition of being re-released through compilations and digital distribution services for various consoles. Conversions for microcomputers were in development but none were officially released to the public.
Liquid Kids enjoyed success in arcades among players, garnering positive reception from critics, while its home conversions were also met with similarly positive response from gaming magazines who reviewed it as an import title.
