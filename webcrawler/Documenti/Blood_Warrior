Titolo: Blood Warrior

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Blood Warrior, known in Japan as Ooedo Fight (大江戸ファイト, Ooedo Faito), is a 1993 fighting arcade game developed by Atop and published by Kaneko. It is the successor to the 1992 fighting arcade game, Shogun Warriors, also developed by Atop and published by Kaneko. Unlike Shogun Warriors, Blood Warrior uses digitized images of real actors within the game instead of traditionally drawn sprites, and its addition of blood and gore draws similarities to Midway's Mortal Kombat franchise.
