Descrizione: LOL, known in Europe as Bakushow and in Japan as Archime DS (アルキメＤＳ, Arukime DS), is a Nintendo DS video game. The game was published by Skip Ltd. in Japan, Agetec in North America, and Rising Star Games in Europe.
Developed by a group of five people headed by Kenichi Nishi, LOL is a multiplayer game implemented with a PictoChat-like interface in which a host player asks a question, requiring others to write or draw their answers on the DS touchscreen.
The developers refer to LOL as a "comedy-training" game with the tagline of the game being "If you think this game is boring, you are boring." LOL received largely mixed reviews by critics upon its release.
