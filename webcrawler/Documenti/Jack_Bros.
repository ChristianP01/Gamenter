Titolo: Jack Bros.

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Jack Bros. is an action video game developed and published by Atlus for the Virtual Boy, released in late 1995 in Japan and North America. It is a spin-off from Atlus' video game series Megami Tensei, and was the first entry to be released outside Japan.
The player takes the role of one of the three Jack brothers – Jack Frost, Jack Lantern, or Jack Skelton – who have visited the human world for Halloween, and need to return to the fairy world before the portal connecting the two worlds closes. The player needs to make their way through six areas, which consist of a number of floors, defeating enemies by using character-specific attacks and collecting keys to be able to advance to the next floor. It received generally positive reception for its gameplay, but was criticized for the lack of puzzle elements and under-utilization of the Virtual Boy's 3D effect.
