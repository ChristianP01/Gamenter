Titolo: Active Lancer

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Active Lancer is a 2D shoot 'em up video game created by Freeverse for Mac OS 9 and macOS. It plays in the style of many old school computer games and features little plot line or story development. The demo is downloadable from macgamefiles.com. There are several levels the player is required to complete. It lacks a multiplayer mode but two players can play together on the same computer.  It was much less successful than Freeverse's popular WingNuts Series.
It was re-released as part of a 'Best of Original Mac Games' bundle from Freeverse.
