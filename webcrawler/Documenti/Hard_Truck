Descrizione: Hard Truck is a series of trucking simulators and racing video games published in the United States by ValuSoft. The series consists of three main titles and a spin-off. Despite the shared name, this series is a result of poor marketing and misrepresentation of several other Russian game series titles like Дальнобойщики (4 games), Ex Machina (3 games) and 18 Стальных Колес (8 games) on foreign English speaking market by unscrupulous publisher.
