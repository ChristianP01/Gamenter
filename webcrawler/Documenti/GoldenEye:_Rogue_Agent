Titolo: GoldenEye: Rogue Agent

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: GoldenEye: Rogue Agent is a first-person shooter video game in the James Bond franchise, developed by EA Los Angeles and published by Electronic Arts.  The player takes the role of an ex-MI6 agent, who is recruited by Auric Goldfinger (a member of a powerful unnamed criminal organization based on Ian Fleming's SPECTRE) to assassinate his rival Dr. No. Several other characters from the Bond franchise make appearances throughout the game, including Pussy Galore, Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp and Francisco Scaramanga.
Despite its name and being part of the James Bond franchise, this James Bond video game has no relation to the 1995 film or the 1997 video game of the same name, and is the first James Bond video game where the titular character does not appear in person.  In this setting the game's protagonist is given the name 'GoldenEye' after he loses his eye and receives a gold-colored cybernetic replacement. Electronic Arts has listed the title along with 007 Racing (2000) as spin-offs that do not make part of the canon they have built with Tomorrow Never Dies (1999).
GoldenEye: Rogue Agent received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics who praised the unique premise and multiplayer mode, but criticised the bland gameplay, plot, departure from the Bond canon, and misleading use of the GoldenEye name.
