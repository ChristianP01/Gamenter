Titolo: Jump Bug

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Jump Bug is a 1981 scrolling platform-shooter game developed by Alpha Denshi under contract for Hoei Corporation. It was distributed in arcades by Sega in Japan and Europe, and by Rock-Ola in North America. It was the first platform game to include smooth horizontal and vertical scrolling. Jump Bug was ported to the Emerson Arcadia and the Leisure Vision system.
The game uses a limited form of parallax scrolling, with the main scene scrolling while starry night sky is fixed and clouds move slowly, adding depth to the scenery. This was a year before Moon Patrol (1982), with its three moving layers.
