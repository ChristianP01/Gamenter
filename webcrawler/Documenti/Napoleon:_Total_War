Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Napoleon: Total War is a turn-based strategy and real-time tactics video game developed by Creative Assembly and published by Sega for the Microsoft Windows and macOS. Napoleon was released in North America on 23 February 2010, and in Europe on 26 February. The game is the sixth stand-alone installment in the Total War series. The game is set in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. Players assume the role of Napoleon Bonaparte, or one of his major rivals, on a turn-based campaign map and engage in the subsequent battles in real-time. As with its predecessor, Empire: Total War, which included a special United States storyline, Napoleon features three special campaigns that follow the general's career.
Napoleon received generally favourable reviews from video game critics. Reviews praised the game's visuals, story driven campaigns, and new gameplay features. Some reviewers were critical of the game's weak AI, high system requirements, and its limited scope – while others considered Napoleon overly similar to Empire, its immediate predecessor in the series.
An entirely new campaign, the Peninsular Campaign, was released 25 June 2010 as downloadable content. It was later released in retail as part of the Empire and Napoleon Total War – Game of the Year Edition compilation pack on 2 October 2010.
The macOS version of the game, containing the Peninsular Campaign and additional unit packs, was announced by Feral Interactive on 28 January 2013. It was released for the Mac on 3 July 2013.French actor Stéphane Cornicard provided voice-acting for Napoleon Bonaparte in the original English, German, French, and Spanish editions.
