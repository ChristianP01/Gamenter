Descrizione: Before Your Eyes is a 2021 adventure game developed by GoodbyeWorld Games and published by Skybound Games. It was released on Microsoft Windows on 8 April 2021. The game is noted for its use of eye-tracking technology in its story telling, being a full imagining of the team's previous project Close Your, which was funded through a Kickstarter campaign.
The game follows the story of the recently deceased Benjamin Brynn on his way to the afterlife. The player must interact with Brynn's memories through an eye-tracking webcam to progress, as the game reads and responds to the player's eye movement and blinking. The game's narrative was well received by critics, however, the functionality of its eye-tracking feature received criticism.
