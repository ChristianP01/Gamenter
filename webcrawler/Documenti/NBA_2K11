Descrizione: NBA 2K11 is a 2010 basketball simulation video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports. It was released in October 2010 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360, and Nintendo Wii. As the twelfth installment in the NBA 2K series, it is the successor to NBA 2K10 and the predecessor to NBA 2K12. Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls is the cover athlete of the game. This is the first game in the series to be compatible with the PlayStation Move.
The game strives to realistically depict the experience of the National Basketball Association (and the NBA G League in association mode). Players mainly play NBA basketball games in a variety of game modes with real and customizable players and teams. MyPlayer mode is one of the modes. In it, players create their own player and play through their career in the NBA. A mode called Association is also present, in which the player assumes control of an NBA organization, and simulates through seasons. Two new modes focusing on Michael Jordan are introduced, as are classic NBA teams. Online modes and quick play options among others are also available.
NBA 2K11 received positive reviews from critics upon release. Positive comments were directed at the overall gameplay and presentation, as well as the introduction of the Michael Jordan-centric modes, while negative comments were concerning the presence of technical issues. By August 2011, the game had sold over 5.5 million copies worldwide. The game is the series' first 2010s entry.
