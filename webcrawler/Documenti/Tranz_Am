Descrizione: Tranz Am is an action video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game that was released for the ZX Spectrum in July 1983. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic version of the United States and centres around a racing car driver on his quest to obtain the Eight Great Cups of Ultimate, which are scattered throughout the country.
The game was written by Chris Stamper and graphics were designed by Tim Stamper. Tranz Am was one of the very few Spectrum games also available in ROM format for use with the Interface 2, allowing instant loading of the game (the normal method of cassette loading could take several minutes). The game received mostly positive reviews upon release: praise was given to the game's graphics and simple controls, while criticism was directed at its confusing interface.
