Titolo: Mass Effect 2: Overlord

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Mass Effect 2: Overlord is a downloadable content pack developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for the 2010 action role-playing video game Mass Effect 2. It was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in 2010, and is included in the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2, which was released in 2011. Set on a remote Earth-like planet during the 22nd century, Overlord follows the events of an experimental virtual intelligence that has gone rogue after a scientist interfaced his autistic brother's mind with it.
Overlord features a new series of missions involving both on-foot squad-based combat and planetary exploration aboard a hovering vehicle called the Hammerhead. Its vehicle exploration aspect was designed to be similar to that of the Mako carrier in the original Mass Effect. Overlord received positive reviews from critics, who praised its tense atmosphere and open-ended exploration, but criticized the Hammerhead's simplistic mechanics. In 2021, Overlord was remastered as part of the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
