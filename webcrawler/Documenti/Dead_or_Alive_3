Descrizione: Dead or Alive 3 (Japanese: デッドオアアライブ3, Hepburn: Deddo Oa Araibu Surī, abbreviated as DOA3) is a 2001 fighting video game developed by Team Ninja and published by Tecmo for the Xbox console as one of its launch titles. It is the third main entry in the Dead or Alive fighting series. Dead or Alive 3 improved upon the gameplay and graphics in superior detail compared to that of its predecessors. 
The game's story focuses on DOATEC's attempt to create the ultimate human weapon through the Omega project by transforming the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan's Hajin Mon leader Genra into the evil superhuman, Omega, and the ninjas entering the third Dead or Alive tournament to defeat him. 
Dead or Alive 3 was very well received. It was a commercial success upon release, selling over 1 million copies worldwide in the first five months after its release, becoming one of the top best selling Xbox games. The game was later followed by Dead or Alive Ultimate in 2004 and Dead or Alive 4 in 2005. In November 2021, it was made available on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S through backward compatibility.
