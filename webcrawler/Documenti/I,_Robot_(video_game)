Titolo: I, Robot (video game)

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: I, Robot is an arcade shooter game developed and released in 1984 by Atari, Inc. Designed by Dave Theurer, only a total of 750–1000 arcade cabinets were produced. The arcade machine comes with two games. The first is I, Robot, a multi-directional shooter that has the player assume the role of "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984", a servant bot that rebels against Big Brother. The object of the game involves the servant bot going through 126 levels, turning red squares to blue to destroy Big Brother's shield and eye. The player can switch to the second game, Doodle City, a drawing tool that lasts for three minutes.
I, Robot was the first commercially produced arcade video game rendered entirely with real-time, flat-shaded, 3D polygon graphics. Previous real-time 3D graphics were vector lines instead of rasterized polygons, one example being Atari's Tempest (1981) a "tube shooter" which Dave Theurer had also designed and programmed. While Funai's laserdisc game Interstellar (1983) had previously used pre-rendered 3D computer graphics and Simutrek's Cube Quest (1983) had used real-time 3D graphics combined with laserdisc full-motion video backgrounds,  I, Robot was the first arcade game to be rendered entirely with 3D polygon graphics at runtime. It was also the first video game to feature camera-control options. The game's name was originally "Ice Castles", but was changed to "I, Robot".Upon release of the game, I, Robot received poor reception and was a financial flop. Approximately 750–1000 units of the game were created, with few having been confirmed to exist today. However, the remaining arcade cabinets have become rare collectibles and the game has received later praise for its innovative 3D graphics. Author David Ellis listed it as one of the "notable classics" of its time.
