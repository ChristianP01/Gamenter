Descrizione: GunZ: The Second Duel (or simply GunZ 2) is an online third-person shooting game created by South Korean-based MAIET Entertainment. It is the sequel to 2003's GunZ: The Duel. Gunz 2 began its first closed beta test in Korea in early 2011, however it has yet to be released. Gunz 2 is currently greenlit on Steam via its Greenlight program, and has entered into beta testing on February 17, 2014 via Steam Greenlight. The Steam version of Gunz 2 is available for international players, mainly in North America. The European version of Gunz 2 was hosted during its open beta phase by ProSiebenSat.1 Media. On 15 December 2014 the licensing agreement between MAIET Entertainment and Prosieben ended where MAIET opened a Steam server for the European region.On September 4, 2015, a news post on Steam announced that the company MAIET Entertainment is no longer operational. The post also states that all rights for the game were taken over by the company MasangSoft Inc. This sparked anger among the game's fanbase due to the lack of communication from either company.
On March 31, 2017, MasangSoft announced all servers for GunZ 2 except US-West will close on May 10, 2017 at 5:00 PM PST. They cite accumulated deficit as a reason for the closures.
