Descrizione: Mind Walker is a 1986 computer game written by Bill Williams and published by Commodore as one of the first games for the new Amiga 1000 computer. The player is immersed inside a human brain and must cure a psychosis that is threatening the patient's well-being. Many aspects of the game (including enemies and power-ups) play on this psychological theme. The four player avatars, for instance, are the human bodybuilder, the water nymph, the mysterious wizard, and the alien spriggan.
