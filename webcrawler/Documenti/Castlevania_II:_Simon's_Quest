Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Castlevania II: Simon's Quest is a platform-adventure game produced by Konami. It was originally released in Japan in 1987 for the Famicom Disk System, and in North America in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, respectively. It is the second Castlevania game released for the NES, following the original Castlevania in 1986. Set sometime after the events of the first installment, the player once again assumes the role of vampire hunter Simon Belmont, who is on a journey to undo a curse placed on him by Dracula at the end of their previous encounter. Dracula's body was split into five parts, which Simon must find and bring to the ruins of Castle Dracula in order to defeat him. The game notably deviates from the traditional platforming of its predecessor, incorporating role-playing and open world elements.
