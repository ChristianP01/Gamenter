Titolo: Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks is a 2005 action-adventure beat 'em up game developed and published by Midway for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. A spin-off of the Mortal Kombat fighting game series, it is a retelling of the events of Mortal Kombat II (1993). Players control the eponymous Shaolin monks Liu Kang and Kung Lao in either single player or cooperative play as they protect Earthrealm from the forces of Outworld.
A spin-off centered on Liu Kang had been considered since the early 2000s, but was shelved after negative reception to the previous adventure spin-offs, Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997) and Special Forces (2000). Shaolin Monks was officially announced in 2004 as part of Midway's plan to release Mortal Kombat games annually. Developed with the intent of appealing to Mortal Kombat gamers, Shaolin Monks incorporates elements from the fighting game entries, including Fatalities, combos, and a versus mode.
Upon release, the game received positive reviews for transitioning the series into an adventure game and its co-op mode but the narrative and visuals earned mixed responses. It was also a commercial success, selling over one million copies.
