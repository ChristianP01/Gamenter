Titolo: Looping (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Looping is a 1982 action game developed and published in arcades by Video Games GmbH in Europe and Venture Line in North America. The player controls a plane across two phases in order to reach a docking station by destroying a terminal base or a rocket base to open a gate while avoiding obstacles along the way.
Conceived by Italian designer and engineer Giorgio Ugozzoli, Looping was the second of two original games produced by German game developer Video Games GmbH, the first being Super Tank (1981). The idea came up during a period when Ugozzoli obtained a license for both gliding and engine aircraft due to being a fan of flying. He was chosen by Video Games GmbH due to being one of the few people in Europe at the time working with the TMS1000, as Texas Instruments suggested him to Video Games GmbH when looking for ideas and developers for a new project using the 8-bit TMS9980 processor. It was ported to the ColecoVision by Nuvatec in 1983. Conversions for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision were planned but never released.
Looping was met with mixed reception from critics since its release on the ColecoVision but became one of the top-selling cartridges for the console in 1983; praise was given to the arcade-accurate presentation but others felt mixed in regards to sound design, while criticism was geared towards the frustrating gameplay and sensitive controls. A follow-up titled Sky Bumper (1982) was developed shortly after the game's launch without involvement of Ugozzoli and released by Venture Line.
