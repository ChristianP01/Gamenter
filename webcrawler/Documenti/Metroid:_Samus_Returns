Titolo: Metroid: Samus Returns

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Metroid: Samus Returns is an action-adventure game developed by Nintendo EPD and MercurySteam and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS handheld game console. It is a remake of the 1991 Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus. Players control series protagonist Samus Aran, a bounty hunter who is contracted by the Galactic Federation to exterminate the parasitic Metroid species on their home planet of SR388.
While the story and structure parallel the original game, Samus Returns features redone graphics, updated controls and user interface, and new gameplay mechanics not seen in previous 2D Metroid titles, such as a melee counterattack and the ability to aim freely at any angle. Development began in 2015, overseen by longtime producer Yoshio Sakamoto. 
Samus Returns received positive reviews upon release for its visuals and improvements over the original version, with many also deeming it a return to form for the series. Sakamoto was impressed with MercurySteam's understanding of the series, leading to their continued partnership for Metroid Dread (2021) on the Nintendo Switch.
