Titolo: Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Link: The Faces of Evil and Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon are two action-adventure video games developed by Animation Magic and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i. The two games were released on the same day, were developed simultaneously and look and play similarly because they use the same graphic engine. Both games are based on Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda franchise, but are not considered official entries in the game series, and are the first two games of three Zelda titles released for the CD-i. The third Zelda game released for the CD-i, Zelda's Adventure, featured different developers and perspective than its predecessors.
Link: The Faces of Evil puts the player in control of Link, who goes on a quest to defeat Ganon and rescue Princess Zelda. Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon changes the roles and has the player control Zelda, who goes out to save Link and King Harkinian and defend her kingdom from Ganon. Both travel to a new world (Koridai and Gamelon, respectively) to thwart Ganon's plans. At the time of their release the games received mixed to positive reviews. In later years, both games, along with Zelda's Adventure and Mario game Hotel Mario, have become infamous with modern critics, which has led to the three games being considered not only the worst games in the Zelda franchise but also among the worst video games of all time.
