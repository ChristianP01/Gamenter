Titolo: Meme Run

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Meme Run is an endless running video game created by American indie developer Ninja Pig Studios (Jordan Schuetz and his brother) for the Wii U console's eShop service. The game features extensive use of Internet memes; for example, the player character is a stick figure with a trollface for a head, and the levels are made up of Lenny faces. The game was designed to appeal to both hardcore and casual audiences, but has been widely criticized both before and after its release for its perceived low quality.
The game was removed from the Nintendo eShop on March 3, 2015 by artist Carlos Ramirez due to unlicensed use of the trollface by the developers.
