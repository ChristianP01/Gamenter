Titolo: Doctor Pong

Anno: 1975

Descrizione: Doctor Pong, also known as Puppy Pong was an adaption of the original arcade
Pong for use in a non-coin-operated environment. It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell, Steve Bristow and a marketing firm to move their arcade games into a non-arcade environmentâ€”in this case to help occupy children in pediatricians' waiting rooms. Originally designed to be model of  Snoopy's doghouse with Pong built into the side of it, when Charles Schulz declined Atari the use of Snoopy the model was changed to a generic doghouse with a puppy looking over the top. Puppy Pong saw a limited production run and was in testing stage at Chuck E. Cheese's early locations.
