Titolo: The Adventures of Quik & Silva

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: The Adventures of Quik & Silva is a platform video game originally released on May 10, 1991 in the UK for the Amiga and Atari ST. The game was developed by members of Kaiko pseudonymously as New Bits On The RAM (presumably a play on New Kids on the Block), and was first published as a covermounted disk on Amiga Fun magazine. The game was later available in 1992 as public domain software, with the Amiga version reviewed in issue 18 of Amiga Power.The various enemies in the game are based on characters from other titles, such as Bubble Bobble, Nebulus, R-Type, and Super Mario. Though, because the game was released as a cover-disk game, this allowed them to get away with the possible infringement, at least for a few months. The game was not seen anywhere out of the UK during its cover-disk release, and only started to gain traction when it had finally become public domain software.
This game is also notable for being the first home video game to feature Sonic the Hedgehog, albeit in an unofficial capacity, as an enemy.
