Titolo: Bible Black

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Bible Black (バイブルブラック, Baiburu Burakku) is an eroge video game developed by ActiveSoft and published on July 14, 2000. Sei Shoujo is the original creator of the game's artwork, character design and penned the original script for the game.
Milky Studio has since adapted the game into several adult anime adaptations. The first adaptation, simply titled Bible Black, consisted of six episodes animating numerous scenes from the video game. The following year, a two-episode OVA titled Bible Black: Origins was released, which served as a prequel to the events of Bible Black. In April 2004, Milky Studio produced a sequel series titled Bible Black: New Testament, which follows the exploits of the original characters ten years after Bible Black takes place. The latest OVA adaption, Bible Black Only, consists of gaiden stories explaining what happened to various characters during the plot of Bible Black.
The game was republished in 2006 as Bible Black Slim featuring extended scenes, followed by a short sequel named Bible Black Infection in 2008. Neither of these games involved the original artist/writer Sei Shoujo as he had left ActiveSoft by this time.
