Descrizione: Nostalgia 1907 is a 1991 adventure video game developed and published by Sur de Wave. Originally released for the Sharp X68000, it was later ported to the FM Towns Marty, PC-9801, and Sega Mega CD. The player assumes the role of a passenger aboard a cruise liner named the Nostalgia that has been taken captive by a criminal looking for an artifact.
After completing Cocoron for the Famicom, Sur de Wave set out to make their next game much more ambitious and story-centric. It was designed by Kouichi Yotsui, who previously created Strider for Capcom. He chose to make the game a text-based adventure as he was a fan of the genre and felt it made for a much more engaging experience compared to the arcade games he was accustom to. Inspiration for the game was taken from the 1974 film The Juggernaut, as well as real-world events such as the Industrial Revolution, and various American spy novels and comic books.
Though Nostalgia 1907 received praise for its ambition and unique cinematic atmosphere, critics disliked its dialogue for being awkward and its lack of player interactivity making it boring to play. It was a commercial failure, putting Sur de Wave in an unrecoverable financial crisis shortly after its release. The game has since received a cult following.
