Titolo: Vampire: The Masquerade (Choice of Games)

Anno: 2021

Descrizione: Vampire: The Masquerade is a line of interactive fiction video games based on the tabletop game of the same name, and is part of the World of Darkness series. They are developed by Choice of Games for Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS, Microsoft Windows, and web browsers, and include Night Road (2020) by Kyle Marquis, Out for Blood (2021) by Jim Dattilo, Parliament of Knives (2021) by Jeffrey Dean, and the upcoming Sins of the Sires (2022) by Natalia Theodoridou.
The games are text-based, and involve the player creating and customizing a character, and making choices that affect the direction of the plot. In Night Road, the player takes the role of a courier delivering secrets for vampire elders in the Southwestern United States; in Out for Blood, a vampire hunter who protects their town; in Parliament of Knives, a vampire navigating vampire politics following a coup in Ottawa, Canada; and in Sins of the Sires, a vampire in Athens, Greece, where an ancient vampire is rumored to plan to rule over humans as a god.
Choice of Games approached Paradox Interactive, the owner of the World of Darkness series, to pitch a video game adaptation as they considered the series and its Storyteller System foundation to match up well with Choice of Games' design philosophies of game mechanics used to support rather than dominate stories. The writers differed in how they chose to adapt the tabletop game: Marquis adhered closely to the source material, while Dean adapted game mechanics more loosely.
