Descrizione: Hourglass of Summer (夏色の砂時計, Natsuiro no Sunadokei) is a Japanese visual novel that was released by Princess Soft. It was brought to the U.S. by the Hirameki International Group. It was one of the first interactive dating games to be translated into English (although there was never an English voice dub for the US release). Originally, it was released exclusively in Japan in a PlayStation 2 format that could only be played on Japanese systems. Later, a PC version, also exclusively Japanese, was released, only this time with erotic content added to it. The U.S. version was released as an interactive DVD that didn't contain sexual content.
Hourglass of Summer also has a 2 episode OVA that was released in Japan. It was animated by Rikuentai and Picture Magic, with direction by Takahiro Okao, scripts by Isao Shizuya, character designs by Yasunari Nitta, and music composed by Yuuichi Oota and Ryou Sakai.
