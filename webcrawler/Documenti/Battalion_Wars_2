Titolo: Battalion Wars 2

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Battalion Wars 2, released as Assault!! Famicom Wars VS in Japan, is a real-time tactics video game, developed by Kuju Entertainment, and released by Nintendo exclusively for the Wii console on 29 October 2007. It is the sequel to the 2005 game Battalion Wars, in which players take command of a battalion of troops to complete missions and defeat opposing forces in battle. The game amended some existing gameplay from the previous title, while introducing new elements, including multiplayer modes, naval units, and base structures. The game's single-player story focuses on a new conflict emerging following the previous war that is being used to mask the search for a powerful ancient superweapon, with players taking charge of troops across three campaigns in the present, and two set at different points in the past.
The game received generally favorable reviews, though with some criticism levied on various areas including the game's controls. The game's online multiplayer modes became unavailable for use, as a result of Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection shutting down in 20 May 2014.
