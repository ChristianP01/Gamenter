Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Galaga Legions is a 2008 twin-stick shooter video game developed and released by Namco Bandai Games for the Xbox 360. It is the twelfth game in the Galaxian series, and the third developed for home platforms. The player controls a starship, the AEf-7 "Blowneedle", in its efforts to wipe out the Galaga armada. The objective of the game is to clear each of the five stages as quick as possible. Stages have a heavy emphasis on puzzle solving and chain reactions, which are necessary to clear out enemy formations. The Blowneedle has a pair of satellites at its disposal, and can place them anywhere on the screen to fend off enemies.
Development began in August 2007, headed by director Tadashi Iguchi, with the goal being to iron out many of the flaws present in the original Galaga while offering a brand new gameplay experience. It was created to be appealing for both hardcore shoot'em up players as well as newcomers to the series. The twin-stick gameplay was added to both show off technical capabilities of the next-generation platforms it ran upon, as well as to keep the fundamentals of the original Galaga. Gaplus, the third entry in the series, was a major source of inspiration for the game. Early versions referred to the game as Galaga Evolution Edition.
Upon release, Galaga Legions was met with a favorable reception from critics, often being compared to Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved. Reviewers applauded the game's visuals, strategic gameplay and addictive nature, although would heave criticism for its high price point and little resemblance to the original. A direct sequel game, titled Galaga Legions DX, was released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows Phone in 2011, being the second game under the Namco Generations label. The original game was ported to the Nintendo 3DS in 2012 as part of the compilation game Pac-Man & Galaga Dimensions.
