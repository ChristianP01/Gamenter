Anno: 2019

Descrizione: Dr Kawashima's Brain Training for Nintendo Switch, known as Nintendo Switch Brain Training for Adults in Japanese, is the fifth entry in the Brain Age puzzle video game series, based on the research of neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima, whose avatar guides the player through the game. It was co-developed by Nintendo EPD and indieszero, and published by Nintendo for Nintendo Switch. It was released on December 27, 2019, in Japan, and January 3, 2020, in Europe and Australia. The game was planned to be released in North America, but it didn't make the cut.
Dr Kawashima's Brain Training for Nintendo Switch builds upon previous installments by adding puzzles and mini-games to strengthen the player's memory and concentration skills. The game contains previous puzzles in the series, all of which are taught by Dr. Kawashima. Puzzles in the game take advantage of some of the Nintendo Switch's functionalities such as the gyroscope and IR sensors. Physical editions of the game include a stylus to aid its touchscreen puzzles as an alternative to using the fingers. The game received generally mixed reviews from critics with praise for the use of the Switch's technology, puzzles, and replay value, though many felt the game lacked innovation and variety.
