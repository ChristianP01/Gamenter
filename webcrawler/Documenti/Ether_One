In Ether One, the player assumes the role of a "Restorer", whose job is to investigate the thoughts of Jean Thompson, a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with dementia. The player must reconstruct Thompson's memories using three-dimensional simulations of the details she can remember in the town of Pinwheel, solving puzzles that become more obtuse throughout the gameplay, as the patient's thoughts continue to grow more unstable.
Ether One took around three years to complete and was released to positive critical reception, particularly for its atmosphere and immersive themes, while its narrative divided critics. The game's portrayal of dementia in the Jean Thompson character was also praised by numerous critics, such as The New Yorker and Kotaku.
