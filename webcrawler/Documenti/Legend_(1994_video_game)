Titolo: Legend (1994 video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Legend is a side-scrolling hack and slash beat 'em up video game developed by Arcade Zone and originally published in North America by Seika Corporation on April 1994 and later in Europe by Sony Electronic Publishing on December 21 of the same year for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the first game to be solely developed by the duo of Carlo Perconti and Lyes Belaidouni at Arcade Zone, who both would later go on to found Toka and HyperDevbox Japan respectively.
Taking place in the fictional kingdom of Sellech during the middle ages, players take control of the knight warriors Kaor and Igor in an attempt to defeat the corrupt son of the king of Sellech, Clovis, before he manages to harness power from the imprisoned soul of maleficent despot Beldor and conquers the land as a result. Inspired by several high fantasy medieval-themed beat 'em up arcade games from Capcom and Sega, Legend was conceived as an idea by Perconti and Belaidouni to create their own action-oriented project.
Legend garnered mixed reception from critics since its initial release on the Super NES. While the graphics received unanimous praise, many of the reviewers felt divided in regards to the sound department and gameplay, which was deemed by some as repetitive. Although it never received a direct sequel, Toka later created a remake of the game for the PlayStation which was also called Legend. In 2015, the original game was ported to Microsoft Windows by independent developer and publisher Piko Interactive. A spiritual successor, Konan, was also in development and planned for the Atari Jaguar by both Perconti and Belaidouni but was never finished and released.
