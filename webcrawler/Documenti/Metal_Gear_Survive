Titolo: Metal Gear Survive

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Metal Gear Survive is a 2018 survival game developed by Konami Digital Entertainment and published by Konami. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February. It is the first Metal Gear game to be developed following the series' creator Hideo Kojima's departure from Konami in late 2015, and the first since 1990's Snake's Revenge to be made without Kojima's input. The game takes place between the events of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and follows the Captain, an MSF soldier who enters a parallel dimension and establishes a local command center to unravel the mysteries of a strange virus that turns people into zombie-like creatures.
Pre-release reception of the game was generally negative, in response to its design and recent business decisions from Konami. Upon release, Metal Gear Survive received a mixed reception from critics. Due to its low sales within the Metal Gear series, the game was considered to have underperformed commercially.
