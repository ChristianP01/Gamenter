Titolo: WarGames (video game)

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: WarGames is a 1984 video game developed by Coleco for the ColecoVision, and later ported to the 
Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64. The game's goal is to defend the United States against nuclear attack, much in the style of a less frantic Missile Command. The principal designer was Coleco staffer Joseph Angiolillo.Joseph Angiolillo presented a one-hour seminar on the creation of WarGames at the August 2011 Board Game Players Convention in Lancaster, PA where he showed a DVD of his creation process and memos and lists from Coleco showing the designers of each Coleco product.
The game was directly inspired by MGM's 1983 film WarGames, but instead of depicting the film's events, it adapts its iconic NORAD scene into playable form.
