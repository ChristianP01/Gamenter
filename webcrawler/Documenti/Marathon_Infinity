Titolo: Marathon Infinity

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Marathon Infinity is a first-person shooter video game, the third in the science fiction Marathon Trilogy by Bungie. The game was released on October 15, 1996 and included more levels than its predecessor Marathon 2: Durandal. These were larger, and formed part of a more intricate plot that spanned both space and time. Marathon Infinity, unlike Marathon 2, was originally released only for the Apple Macintosh. However, Bungie released the source for Marathon 2 in 1999, allowing the development of the open-source multiplatform Aleph One engine that is also compatible with Infinity. In 2005, Bungie released the trilogy to the public as freeware, allowing the games to be freely downloaded. In 2011, Bungie released the source code for Marathon Infinity itself, preceding an official Aleph One-based port for iOS the next year that is available free (with in-app purchases).
