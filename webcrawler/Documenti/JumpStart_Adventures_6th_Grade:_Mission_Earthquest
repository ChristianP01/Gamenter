Descrizione: JumpStart Adventures 6th Grade: Mission Earthquest is a game created by Knowledge Adventure in the JumpStart series. In this game A.R.T., a computer with artificial intelligence, has gone haywire, and now wants to "redesign the chaotic system that is Earth". Zack and Jess, twin brother and sister agents of Earthquest, stop him with the help of their Uncle Eli and dog Roswell. A.R.T. seems to be inspired by HAL 9000 from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.
JumpStart 6th Grade is now part of a 5-disc set called JumpStart Advanced 4th-6th Grade, along with JumpStart Adventures 5th Grade: Jo Hammet, Kid Detective, JumpStart Adventures 4th Grade: Sapphire Falls, and two bonus discs.
