Descrizione: Resident Evil 2 is a 2019 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. A remake of the 1998 game of the same name, it was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on January 25, 2019. Players control rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a viral outbreak, that transforms the citizens into zombies and other creatures.
Capcom first considered remaking Resident Evil 2 following the release of the remake of the first Resident Evil in 2002, but was delayed as series creator Shinji Mikami did not want to divert development from the then-upcoming Resident Evil 4 (2005). Capcom announced the Resident Evil 2 remake in August 2015 and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at E3 2018.
Resident Evil 2 received critical acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original and was nominated for several awards, including for game of the year. As of 2021, the game had sold over eight million copies, outselling the original.
