Descrizione: Double Dragon Neon is a 2012 beat 'em up video game in the Double Dragon series. It was developed by WayForward Technologies and published by Majesco Entertainment, and it is the reboot of the Double Dragon series. It was the first game in the series where Million, the previous owner of the Double Dragon series after Technōs Japan became defunct, had no involvement in its development. Arc System Works bought the series rights in 2015 along with all intellectual properties of Technōs Japan.
Series creator Yoshihisa Kishimoto was consulted during the game's development, and described Neon as "a very western adaptation of Double Dragon" with certain mechanics taken from the previous games, and a "mood and feel" that reminded him of the original arcade game.
