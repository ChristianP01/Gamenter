Descrizione: Polanie is a historical real-time strategy video game developed by MDF and published by USER for DOS and Microsoft Windows in 1996. An enhanced CD version was released next year.
It was the first Polish RTS game and has been since described as a cult classic in Poland. It was followed by Polanie II in 2003. The planned third game, Polanie 3, eventually turned into an unrelated action RPG Two Worlds. A canceled remake of the original has been in development during the 2010s.
