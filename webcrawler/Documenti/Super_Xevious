Titolo: Super Xevious

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Super Xevious is a 1984 vertical-scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco in Japan. It is an updated version of Xevious (1983), created as a response to the overwhelming success of the original in Japan. Like the original game, the player controls a starship known as the "Solvalou", equipped with two weapons: an "air zapper" to defeat flying enemies, and a "blaster bomb" to destroy ground-based enemies. It runs on the Namco Galaga arcade board. New enemy types include metallic Galaxian flagships. Some of these revert the player's score to zero if destroyed. It has been ported to the Sharp X68000 and PlayStation, alongside inclusion in several Namco collections.
