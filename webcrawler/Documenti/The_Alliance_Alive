Descrizione: The Alliance Alive is a role-playing video game for the Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console developed by Cattle Call, with assistance from Grezzo and FuRyu. The game was published in Japan by FuRyu in 2017, and was published worldwide by Atlus USA in 2018. The story follows a group of characters as they mount a rebellion against a race of Daemons that have ruled over humans since blotting out the sun a millennium before. Gameplay follows many traditions of the Japanese role-playing genre, including turn-based battles and navigation using a world map.
Development of The Alliance Alive began following the completion of The Legend of Legacy in 2015, although its concept predated the creation of The Legend of Legacy. The aim was to create a classic role-playing game balancing gameplay and story which used player feedback from the previous game. Most of the original staff returned including director Masataka Matsuura, artist Ryo Hirao, designer Kyoji Koizumi, and composer Masashi Hamauzu. The scenario was written by Yoshitaka Murayama, noted for his work on the Suikoden series. This is the last FuRyu game to be published by Atlus USA before moving to NIS America for future titles.
A high-definition remaster under the title The Alliance Alive HD Remastered for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch was released in October 2019. This version of the game was also released for Microsoft Windows in January 2020, and  released on Android and iOS in February 2021.
