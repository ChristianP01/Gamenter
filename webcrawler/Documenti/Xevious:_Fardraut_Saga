Titolo: Xevious: Fardraut Saga

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Xevious: Fardraut Saga is a 1988 vertical-scrolling shooter video game published by Namco for the MSX2 in Japan. An updated PC Engine version was released two years later. The fifth entry in the Xevious franchise, the player controls a spaceship in its mission to vanquish the Xevious forces before its supercomputer leader GAMP wipes out the entirety of mankind. The player uses two weapons, an air zapper to destroy air-based enemies, and a blaster bomb to destroy ground-based enemies.
Fardraut Saga was part of Namco's attempt to bring the Xevious series back into popularity, after games such as Gradius began winning over players in arcades. Their previous attempt, Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo, was widely-disliked by fans and a commercial flop. Instead of being produced in-house, Namco enlisted the help of Japanese studio Compile, known for creating the Puyo Puyo, Zanac, and Aleste series, to develop it. Production was led by Compile founder Masamitsu "Moo" Mitani. The MSX2 was chosen as the platform to produce the game on due to Compile having previously developed many games for it.
Fardraut Saga received mixed reviews. Critics focused primarily on the game's high difficulty and average graphics, alongside with it lacking replay value and having poor music and sound effects. The inclusion of the original Xevious and its new gameplay mechanics had received praise. It was followed by the 3D spin-off Solvalou in arcades in 1991.
