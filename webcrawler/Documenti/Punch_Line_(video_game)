Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Punch Line is a visual novel adventure video game developed by 5pb., based on the anime television series of the same name. It was published for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita by 5pb. in Japan in 2016, and is planned to be published by PQube in North America and Europe in 2018. A Microsoft Windows version was planned for release on August 31, 2018, for Europe and September 25, 2018, for North America, but was later delayed to 2019.
The player controls Yuuta Iridatsu, a ghost who seeks to return to his body, and solves puzzles while haunting a house and using poltergeist abilities such as possession.
The game was written by Kotaro Uchikoshi and scored by Tetsuya Komuro, with character designs by Sh≈çta Iwasaki, all three of whom previously worked on the Punch Line anime, and was directed by Takumi Nakazawa and produced by Kazuhiro Ichikawa.
Owing to its origins as an anime adaptation, the game is structured akin to an interactive anime, and intersplices scenes from the anime show into its narrative.
