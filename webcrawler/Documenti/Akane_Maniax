Titolo: Akane Maniax

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Akane Maniax 〜Nagareboshi Densetsu Gouda〜 (アカネマニアックス〜流れ星伝説剛田〜) is a visual novel released for the PC by âge. It is a prequel of sorts to Muv-Luv and side story to Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, and features Akane Suzumiya from Kimi ga Nozomu Eien as its main heroine. Like Muv-Luv Extra and unlike Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, it focuses more on comedy than drama.
The game starts several weeks after the end of Kimi ga Nozomu Eien and ends a day before Muv-Luv Extra starts. Most of the main characters from Muv-Luv can be seen in the game. It was originally released in parts with Tech GIAN without voice acting, but was later released as a game with full voice acting for members of âge's official fanclub.
There is also a three episode OVA roughly based on the game, with the first DVD released on November 25, 2004. The series was animated by Silver. Many characters in the game parody Tekkaman and Tekkaman Blade. The OVA mainly parodies robot shows such as Mazinger Z. Akane Maniax marked the first appearance of Gouda Jouji, who would later become a recurring gag character in âge's games.
