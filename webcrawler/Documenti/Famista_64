Titolo: Famista 64

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Famista 64, also known as Family Stadium 64, is a 1997 baseball video game developed and published in Japan by Namco for the Nintendo 64. Controlling one of fourteen selectable teams, both real-world and fictional, the player must score more runs than the opposing team by pitching, batting and catching the ball, as in real baseball. It is the twelfth entry in the Family Stadium series, serving as a 3D remake of the original Pro Baseball: Family Stadium.
Originally intended as an installment in the World Stadium series, Famista 64 was Namco's first video game on a Nintendo platform since 1994, following several long arguments between the two companies since the late 1980s that ended with Namco preferring Sony and their console, the PlayStation, becoming one of the system's dominant third-party developers. It received largely mixed reviews for its simplistic gameplay and lack of replay value. Several also felt disappointed that Namco decided to make their first game for the platform a sports title as opposed to porting several of their PlayStation games, such as the Tekken series.
