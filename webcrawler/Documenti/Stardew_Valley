Titolo: Stardew Valley

Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Stardew Valley is a simulation role-playing video game developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. Initially released for Microsoft Windows in February 2016, versions became available for the major eighth-generation video game consoles—the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch—from late 2016 to late 2017. Mobile operating systems iOS and Android received versions in 2018 and 2019, respectively, with a PlayStation Vita version released midway through 2018.
The player assumes the role of a character who inherits their grandfather's dilapidated farm. The game is open-ended, allowing players to take on a variety of activities. These include growing crops, raising livestock, mining, foraging, selling produce, and socializing with the residents of the nearby Pelican Town, including the ability to marry and have children. 
Barone developed Stardew Valley by himself over four years. He was inspired by the Harvest Moon video game series and sought to address some of what he identified as the series' shortcomings and frustrations. Unable to find a job following his graduation from university, Barone undertook the project in order to improve his programming and artistic skills. British studio Chucklefish approached Barone midway through development; Barone accepted, with the deal offering him the freedom to focus on finishing the game.
Stardew Valley was a critical and commercial success. Critics highlighted the game's music, characters, and relaxing qualities. Barone's decision to include same-sex relationships was also praised. Yasuhiro Wada, the creator of Harvest Moon, praised the game for retaining the freedom that later entries of his series had lost. As of September 2021, Stardew Valley had sold over 15 million copies.
