Descrizione: Blood Wake is a naval combat video game that was released in 2001 on the Xbox as part of Microsoft's initial wave of Xbox launch titles.  The game was developed by Stormfront Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios. Set in an Asian-themed fictional world, Blood Wake is a story-driven, mission-based high seas action game in which the player controls a series of small fighting vessels.
First unveiled at E3 2001, the game received mixed reviews from critics according to the aggregate website Metacritic. Some reviewers described its gameplay as "Twisted Metal on water," although its mission-based story line differentiated Blood Wake from Twisted Metal's arena-based gameplay. The game sold enough copies to be added to Microsoft's budget line, known as Platinum Hits.
