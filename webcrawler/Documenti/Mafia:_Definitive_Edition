Titolo: Mafia: Definitive Edition

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Mafia: Definitive Edition is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K Games. It is a remake of the 2002 video game Mafia, and the fourth main installment in the Mafia series. Like the original game, the remake is set within the fictional city of Lost Heaven, Illinois during the 1930s, and follows the rise and fall of Tommy Angelo, a Sicilian-American cab driver-turned-gangster, within the Salieri crime family.               
The game's open world nature allows players to explore Lost Heaven at their leisure when not completing missions to advance the narrative. This is mostly done in the Free Ride game mode, where players are not restricted by the linear nature of missions and can find hidden side missions and collectibles exclusive to this mode. The gameplay builds upon 2016's Mafia III, and features enhanced mission dynamics and the introduction of motorcycles to the series. While some of the veteran Czech Mafia voice cast returned for the remake, the English voices were recast. An original score was also created for the game.               
The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on September 25, 2020, both individually and as part of the Mafia: Trilogy pack, which also includes a remastered version of the second game and a version of the third game comprised with its additional story packs. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, with praise for revitalizing the story, performances, and graphics, yet faced some criticism over its animations.
