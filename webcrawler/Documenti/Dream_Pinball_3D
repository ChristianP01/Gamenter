Descrizione: Dream Pinball 3D is a pinball simulation game developed by TopWare and published by SouthPeak Games for Microsoft Windows, first released online in 2006, and then ported to Wii and Nintendo DS in 2008. Dream Pinball 3D features six tables to play on, each with a distinct theme, including a medieval table, an aquatic table, a monsters (zombies and vampires mostly) table, and a dinosaurs table.
