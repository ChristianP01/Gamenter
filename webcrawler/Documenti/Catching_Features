Descrizione: Catching Features is a sports simulation video game developed for the sport of orienteering.
Several different modes of play are available. Individual courses are run with interval starts against computer opponents, or with a mass start against many of them. Relay events allow you to run one leg of a forked relay course.
A random map generator lets you create an endless supply of maps and courses to run on. Each course you run will earn you a number of ranking points based on the other runners that day. By earning more points it is possible to unlock additional events to run.
