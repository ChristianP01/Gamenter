Titolo: Artifact (video game)

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Artifact is a digital collectible card game developed and published by Valve. It focuses on online player-versus-player battles, and is based on the universe of Dota 2, a multiplayer online battle arena game also from Valve. Artifact was designed by Magic: The Gathering creator Richard Garfield. It was released for Windows, macOS, and Linux in November 2018.
While Artifact's gameplay and drafting mechanics received praise, it was criticized for its high learning curve and monetization model, which some saw as pay-to-win. It saw a 95% decline in players within two months of its release, with only around a hundred concurrent players by mid-2019. Valve was surprised by the response, describing it as the largest discrepancy between their expectations for a game and the outcome.
Valve reworked the game as Artifact 2.0, altering several features, including removing the need to buy or trade cards with money. It was tested through a closed beta starting in March 2020. A year later, Valve announced that it had ceased development of the game, citing a lack of player interest, and made both versions of the game free to play. The original Artifact was renamed Artifact Classic and Artifact 2.0 was renamed Artifact Foundry.
