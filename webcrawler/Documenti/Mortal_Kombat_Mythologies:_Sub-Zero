Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero is a 1997 action-adventure game developed and published by Midway for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. A spin-off of the Mortal Kombat series, it is the first entry to not be a fighting game. Set before the original 1992 game, players control Bi-Han, the elder Sub-Zero, during his quest to find Shinnok's amulet. It also serves as a prequel to Mortal Kombat 4, which was released the same year, introducing characters and story elements that would be used by the fourth main installment. Mythologies is the final game in the series to use digitized actors.
The game drew a divisive response from critics, with the PlayStation version considered superior to the Nintendo 64 version. Praise was directed at the transition from the fighting game genre to action-adventure and the PlayStation version's live-action cutscenes, but the controls and punishing level design received criticism.
Retrospective reviews were more negative, with some labeling the game as one of the worst Mortal Kombat games ever, as well as one of the worst video games in general.
