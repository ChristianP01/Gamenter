Descrizione: GTI Club is a racing game originally released for the arcades in 1996 by Konami, on their new Cobra arcade board, which uses PowerPC-based hardware. In the original, the player raced around the CÃ´te d'Azur and could choose from 5 rally cars including a Mini Cooper and Renault 5 Alpine Turbo.  The game allowed free-roaming of the environment, which was revolutionary for the time, and contained several semi-hidden shortcuts that could be used to reduce lap times. A handbrake is provided which the player is encouraged to use to perform handbrake turns round sharp corners.
