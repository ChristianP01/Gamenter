Descrizione: Encyclopedia Fuckme and the Case of the Vanishing Entree is an independently developed freeware dating sim developed and written by Anna Anthropy. The game stars a submissive who eagerly goes to Anni, her dominant partner, only to find that Anni plans on eating her for dinner in her house. The player is forced to make branching choices which affect the game's outcome.
Anthropy was inspired by her real-life submissive to create a dating sim that reflected real carnal desires instead of a more standard dating sim, which she perceived to be somewhat exploitative and inhuman. The game has received praise from critics for its unique take on the genre.
