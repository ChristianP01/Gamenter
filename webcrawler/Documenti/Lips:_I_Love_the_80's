Titolo: Lips: I Love the 80's

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Lips: I Love the 80s (Stylised as Lips: I â™¥ the 80s) is a karaoke game for the Xbox 360 games console, and the third follow-up to Lips. Like the other entries in the series, the game uses motion-sensitive wireless microphones, but like Lips: Party Classics it is compatible with USB microphones. It was only released in Europe.
The game also adds 250 Gamerscore to Lips, taking the total Gamerscore for the Lips series to 1750. However, the game was not released in North America making the last 250 unobtainable to western audiences. All songs from the disc could be purchased on the Marketplace instead but none to unlock the additional score. The game is region-free making it possible to be played on a NTSC console thus allowing North Americans to complete the game alongside European gamers.
