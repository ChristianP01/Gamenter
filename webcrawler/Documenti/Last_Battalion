Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Override is a Data East vertical-scrolling shooter game released for the PC Engine in 1991. Later that year, Sting Entertainment, the creator of the original Data East game, developed and self-published a version for the X68000 released as Last Battalion.
It is the first recorded game developed by Sting Entertainment and the X68000 version is now available as a free "one stage only" demo download on Sting's website. On September 4, 2007, G-Mode published the Override version of the game for the Wii Virtual Console which (like its 1991 release) was reserved exclusively for the Japanese market.
