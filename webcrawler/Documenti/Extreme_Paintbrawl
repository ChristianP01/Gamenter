Titolo: Extreme Paintbrawl

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Extreme Paintbrawl is a paintball video game released for DOS/Microsoft Windows on October 31, 1998. The game uses a modified version of the Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition v1.5 executable. The game is considered to be one of the worst video games ever made. Extreme Paintbrawl was developed in two weeks, with a soundtrack by musician Todd Duane, who sent his demo tracks to Head Games. The game was followed by Extreme Paintbrawl 2 in 1999, Ultimate Paintbrawl 3 in 2000, and Extreme Paintbrawl 4 in 2002, all of which were met with negative reviews.
Despite being "distinguished as the first non-violent 3D shooter" by the Philadelphia Daily News, prior examples of non-violent first-person shooters have existed on the market a few years before Extreme Paintbrawl was released, namely Super 3D Noah's Ark by Christian video game developer Wisdom Tree and Chex Quest, an advergame total conversion of Doom for children.
