Titolo: Klonoa: Door to Phantomile

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a platform game developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation in 1997. The story follows Klonoa and his friend Huepow in their efforts to save the dream world of Phantomile from an evil spirit intent on turning it into a world of nightmares. The player controls Klonoa through a 2.5D perspective; the stages are rendered in three dimensions but the player moves along a 2D path. Klonoa can grab enemies and throw them as projectiles, or use them as a jump boost to navigate through the stages.
The game was directed by Hideo Yoshizawa, who conceptualized the setting as a dream world that could appeal to children and adults. The Klonoa character was designed early on and the environments and other characters were designed around him. Door to Phantomile received positive reviews, being praised for its clever platforming, impressive graphics, and cutscenes. Some critics thought it lacked in certain gameplay innovations and was excessive in its Japanese cuteness. In retrospect, it is considered one of the best 2.5D platformers and greatest PlayStation games of all time. It spawned a series of sequels, including Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil (2001) for the PlayStation 2, and a 2008 remake for the Wii.
