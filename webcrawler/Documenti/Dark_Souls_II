Descrizione: Dark Souls II is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Games. The third game in the Souls series, it was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Although both are set in the same universe, there is no overt story connection between the first Dark Souls and the sequel. The game uses dedicated multiplayer servers. Taking place in the kingdom of Drangleic, the game features both player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) gameplay, in addition to having some co-op components. As in the earlier games in the series, it again features challenging gameplay, but with a more powerful graphics engine and more advanced artificial intelligence system.
After some initial delays, the game was released worldwide in March 2014, with the Windows version being released on April 24, 2014. The game received both critical acclaim, and high sales. An updated version of the game, subtitled Scholar of the First Sin, was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Windows in April 2015. The title is a compilation of the original game and all of its downloadable content with upgraded graphics, expanded online multiplayer capacity, and various other changes. A sequel, Dark Souls III, was released in 2016.
