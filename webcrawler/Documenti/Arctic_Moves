Descrizione: Arctic Moves is a run-and-gun game which is the third chapter of the Moves Trilogy and preceded by Army Moves in 1986 as well as Navy Moves in 1987. The game was developed by Dinamic Software for the Atari ST, but this version was not released due to Dinamic's Software bankruptcy (1992). The game was ported to MS-DOS compatible operating systems and published in 1995 by Dinamic Multimedia. The Atari ST version was finally developed by Luis Mariano Garcia (an ex member of Dinamic Software and later, Dinamic Multimedia). An Amiga conversion of the Atari ST version was released in February 2017 by Meynaf.
