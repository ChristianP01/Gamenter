Titolo: Renegade Legion

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Renegade Legion is a series of science fiction games that were designed by Sam Lewis, produced by FASA, and published from 1989 to 1993. The line was then licensed to Nightshift games, a spin-off of the garage company Crunchy Frog Enterprises by Paul Arden Lidberg, which published one scenario book, a gaming aid, and three issues of a fanzine-quality periodical before reverting the license.
Set in the 69th Century, the series allowed gamers to play out the battles between the "Terran Overlord Government (TOG)", a corrupt galactic empire, and the "Commonwealth", an alliance of humans and aliens.  The focus of the plot, like with many strategy games, is to present a long term conflict to enable as many individual situations and environments as possible.  Most of Renegade Legion deals with large, military battles to be played on hexagonal grid mapsheets in a turn-based rules system.
