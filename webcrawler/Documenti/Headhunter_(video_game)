Titolo: Headhunter (video game)

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Headhunter is an action-adventure video game developed by Amuze for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2.
According to John Kroknes, creative director at Amuze, the game was strongly influenced by 1980s action movies and Paul Verhoeven's science fiction films.
For the majority of the game, the gameplay is that of a third-person shooter as players control protagonist Jack Wade. Jack travels between the main levels of the game on his motorcycle, and these sections take the form of a racing game, with the motorbike's acceleration and braking controlled using the sensitive analogue trigger buttons of the Dreamcast control pad.
A sequel was released in 2004 called Headhunter Redemption and it was released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
