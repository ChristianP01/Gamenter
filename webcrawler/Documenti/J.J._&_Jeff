Descrizione: J.J. & Jeff, known in Japan as Kato-chan & Ken-chan (カトちゃんケンちゃん), is a side scrolling platform game for the TurboGrafx-16. The Japanese version of the game is loosely based on the popular comedy television show Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan, which American producer Vin Di Bona used as its inspiration for America's Funniest Home Videos in 1990. The game features off-beat characters and enemies, and toilet humor, including flatulence, urination and defecation in the Japanese release. In 2007, the game was re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console in North America on May 28, and in Europe on June 15.
