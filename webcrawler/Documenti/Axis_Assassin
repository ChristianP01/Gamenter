Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Axis Assassin is a video game written by John Field for the Apple II and published by Electronic Arts in 1983. Ports for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 were released alongside the Apple II original. The game is similar in concept and visuals to Atari, Inc.'s 1981 Tempest arcade game.
Along with M.U.L.E., Hard Hat Mack, Archon: The Light and the Dark, and Worms?, Axis Assassin was one of the five initial titles from Electronic Arts. Author John Field was included in the two-page "We See Farther" magazine ad from 1983 that positioned EA's game developers as "rock stars." Field also wrote The Last Gladiator for Electronic Arts, which was published the same year as Axis Assassin.
