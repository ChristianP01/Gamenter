Descrizione: Dynamite Bowl (ダイナマイトボウル, Dainamaito Bōru) is a 1987 multiplatform video game that simulates the traditional game of bowling. The MSX version was released for both the MSX-1 and the MSX-2 generations of the computer.
The general concept is that up to five players can play on any of the 30 bowling lanes available; simulating the concept of being in a bowling league. Players can change their lane positioning, determine how strong the throw is, and even make the ball go through various curves (or even through a straight ball into the pins). Each player character can be either male or female with options for bowling ball weights ranging from 7 pounds or 3.2 kilograms to 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms.
