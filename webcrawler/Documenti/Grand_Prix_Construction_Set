Descrizione: Grand Prix Construction Set is a racing video game for the BBC Micro released in 1987 by Superior Software. It is a simulation of Formula One coupled with a track editor. It can be played in full screen single-player or two-player split screen modes.
Unlike the majority of Superior's BBC Micro games at the time, it was not possible to convert the game to the Acorn Electron but a game that started out as an Electron equivalent became the BBC/Electron motorbike racing game Crazee Rider.
