Anno: 2019

Descrizione: Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed and published by Grasshopper Manufacture. The game was released for Nintendo Switch on January 18, 2019, and for PlayStation 4 and Windows later that year. Directed by Goichi "Suda51" Suda, the game is part of the No More Heroes franchise and features series protagonist Travis Touchdown fighting Badman, the father of Bad Girl. The two are drawn into a possessed video game console, and must fight through its various games. As the first title he has directed since the first No More Heroes, Suda collaborated with several indie developers to feature elements from their games in Travis Strikes Again. While part of the No More Heroes series, Suda does not consider the game a direct sequel to the previous title No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, but a fresh start for the character Travis.
Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes received mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising its story and imaginative presentation, while finding the game play aspects repetitive. Five months after the game's initial release, No More Heroes III was announced at E3 2019, acting as a follow-up to the game, and a sequel to the series proper, released on the Nintendo Switch on August 27, 2021.
