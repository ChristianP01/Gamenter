Titolo: AirCars

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: AirCars is a shooter video game developed by MidNite Entertainment Group and originally published by ICD exclusively for the Atari Jaguar in North America on June 18, 1997. It was one of the last licensed releases for the system.
Assuming the role of a government pilot assigned to battle against the E.B.N.E.R.S. organization, who plans to dominate a post-apocalyptic world left by a nuclear holocaust, players take control of the titular hovercar-like vehicles in order to destroy their buildings and flying technology across multiple missions set on various locations. Originally announced in 1994 and completed in 1995, the game's release was held up due to a less-than-enthusiastic response from the press and the developer facing financial difficulties, receiving a limited release two years later as a result.AirCars received mixed but mostly negative reception when it was reviewed by video game magazines before its planned 1995 release, with criticism geared towards the graphics, sound and gameplay, while some reviewers complemented its multiplayer capabilities with the CatBox accessory for LAN play but criticized the setup before playing. In 2010, a new version of the title was released as a limited run, similarly to the original release.
