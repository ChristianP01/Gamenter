Descrizione: Carrier (キャリアー, Kyariā) is a survival horror video game for the Dreamcast, notable in part for being fully 3D - then still a rarity for survival horror games, which mostly displayed 3D characters over pre-rendered backgrounds.

A cancelled sequel for the PlayStation 2 titled Carrier: The Next Mutation was once planned for release in February 2001.
