Titolo: Forza Horizon

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Forza Horizon is a 2012 racing video game developed by Playground Games and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox 360 on 23 October 2012. The game is the fifth instalment of the Forza series, having spun-off from the elder Forza Motorsport series.
Taking place during the fictitious Horizon Festival, a street racing event set in the state of Colorado, the aim is to progress via winning races, while also increasing the popularity level by performing stunts. Players can drive off-road in select areas while others are limited by guardrails or other means.
Forza Horizon was released to critical acclaim and has since spawned its own series, with four additional sequels to date: Forza Horizon 2 in 2014, Forza Horizon 3 in 2016, Forza Horizon 4 in 2018, and Forza Horizon 5 in 2021.
