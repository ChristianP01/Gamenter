Titolo: My Empire

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: My Empire was a city building game with an ancient Greco-Roman theme. The game was developed and published by Playfish and was released via Facebook in May 2010. In 2011 My Empire became the inaugural winner of the Social Network Game category at the 2011 BAFTA Video Game Awards.The game was deliberately targeted at an older age range than Playfish's previous Facebook games, as the developer thought that there was an under-served market that the game would be able to capitalise on.Playfish took My Empire and five other games offline in September 2011, citing a lack of players.Playfish had also used the game to experiment with mobile phone integration with Facebook games. In November 2010, it launched an app that allowed users to manage their tax collection and resources in the game via their mobile phone, but the users weren't able to play the full game on the phone.
