Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Boom Blox Bash Party, called Boom Blox Smash Party in non-English territories, is a physics-based puzzle video game developed by EA Los Angeles and published by Electronic Arts for the Wii video game console. It is a sequel to Boom Blox, and was released on 19 May 2009 in North America and in Europe on 29 May 2009. The game features more than 400 levels, and players are able to download new levels and upload their own custom-created levels to share online. Its development began after the completion of its predecessor, and it was formally announced on 28 January 2009. As with the original game, it was designed by film director Steven Spielberg.
The gameplay of Boom Blox Bash Party resembles the original's, but features new mechanics. It has less emphasis on the shooting mode, which the developers commented was their least favorite mode of play in Boom Blox. It was created as part of a deal between Electronic Arts and Steven Spielberg to make three original properties, though it does not count as one of the three original properties. As of April 2012, EA has shut down the online servers, meaning players can no longer upload and download user created games.
