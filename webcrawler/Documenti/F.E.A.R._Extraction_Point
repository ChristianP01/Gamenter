Titolo: F.E.A.R. Extraction Point

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: F.E.A.R. Extraction Point is an expansion pack for the psychological survival horror first-person shooter video game F.E.A.R., published by Vivendi Games and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and developed by TimeGate Studios (rather than Monolith Productions, the developers of F.E.A.R.).  It was released in October 2006 for Microsoft Windows and requires the full original game in order to be played. Also, a stand-alone single player demo has been previously released. It is the first expansion pack in the main F.E.A.R. series. The expansion was ported to the Xbox 360 and released as part of the F.E.A.R. Files package in November 2007.This expansion owes its name to the game's ultimate goal for the player, to reach the extraction point and leave the city where the adventure takes place. Extraction Point adds new weapons, enemies, and single-player levels, but no new multiplayer content. Additional improvements were also made to the enemy artificial intelligence. The sequel to F.E.A.R., F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, ignores the events of both expansion packs.
