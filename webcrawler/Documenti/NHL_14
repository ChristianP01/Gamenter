Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur and Blue Jackets goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky qualified for the final, and Martin Brodeur was announced as the winner on June 28, 2013. NHL 14 marked the first time since NHL 97 that a goaltender was featured on the official cover (John Vanbiesbrouck was on the cover that year), as well as the first goaltender on any official ice hockey video game cover since Marty Turco on 2K Sports' NHL 2K6. Jonas Hiller was featured on the cover of NHL 12, but only in PAL regions.
