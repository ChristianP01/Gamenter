Titolo: Amberstar

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Amberstar is the first installment in Thalion Software's never-finished role-playing video game trilogy. Although considerably more advanced, the game has many similarities to Thalion's earlier game Dragonflight, and was by many fans thought to be a sequel. As with most of Thalion's other releases, the public interest was somewhat limited. A sequel, Ambermoon, was released in 1993.
