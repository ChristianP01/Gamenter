Titolo: Brain Dead 13

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Brain Dead 13 is an interactive movie video game developed and originally published in North America by ReadySoft on 15 December 1995 and in Europe by Empire Interactive on the same year for the MS-DOS. Unlike Dragon's Lair and Space Ace, which began as laserdisc arcade games, it was only released for personal computers and video game consoles. In the game, players assume the role of young computer expert Lance Galahad to defeat Dr. Nero Neurosis at his castle and its residents. Its gameplay is primarily presented through the use of full-motion video (FMV).
Brain Dead 13 was initially released for the MS-DOS before being ported to other platforms including the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Atari Jaguar CD, CD-i, iOS, Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Sega Saturn between 1996 and 2010, with each one featuring various changes and additions compared to the original version. A conversion for the Sega CD was in development but never released.
Brain Dead 13 has been met with mixed critical reception from video game magazines and dedicated outlets that reviewed the game since its original release and later versions. Nevertheless, the game has since gained a cult following.
