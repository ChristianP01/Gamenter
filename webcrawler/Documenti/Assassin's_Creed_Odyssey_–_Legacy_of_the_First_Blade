Titolo: Assassin's Creed Odyssey – Legacy of the First Blade

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Assassin's Creed Odyssey – Legacy of the First Blade is a downloadable content (DLC) pack developed and published by Ubisoft for the 2018 action role-playing video game Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Legacy of the First Blade consists of three episodes: Episode 1: Hunted, Episode 2: Shadow Heritage and Episode 3: Bloodline. The episodes were released periodically between December 2018 to March 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The pack follows a legendary Greek mercenary known as the Eagle Bearer as they face a new threat to the Greek World in the form of the Order of the Ancients, a precursor organisation to the modern day Templar Order, who serve as the perennial antagonists of the Assassin's Creed series. It explores the history behind the signature Hidden Blade weapon of the Brotherhood of Assassins, and how Odyssey is connected to other installments in the Assassin's Creed franchise. 
Legacy of the First Blade is the first major downloadable content pack for Assassin's Creed Odyssey. It was released to a mixed reception from video game publications. The overall quality and thoughtfulness of the story's writing, as well as its engaging cast of characters, have been praised. On the other hand, a pivotal narrative development that sets the player character on a predetermined path to start a family, either out of love or to continue their family bloodline, was poorly received by critics and fans. In response to the controversy, Ubisoft released a patch which made minor adjustments meant to better reflect the nature of the relationship for players who prefer a non-romantic storyline.
