Titolo: GATE (video game)

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: GATE is an action-adventure video game designed by Swiss programmers Henrik Gudat, Jörg Kienzle, and Yann Le Tensorer.  The gameplay is comparable to Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda with a top-down view and a mixture of action, adventure, and puzzle solving.
It was first released for the Apple IIGS in 1991, and requires at least 1MB of RAM.  A stereo card is recommended since it implements 15 channel, stereo background music.  Players are given the option at the beginning of the game to play in either English or French.  The game is not hard drive installable since it uses a custom operating system; therefore a 3.5" disk drive is required to play.GATE was ported to the Macintosh in 1994, by Jörg Kienzle with graphics designed by Valérie Kienzle.  The game requires at least 4MB of RAM and runs on 68k or PowerPC Macs running an operating system between OS 6.0.7 and OS 9.2.2.  Besides playing the game in either English or French, players can also choose German or Kanji in this version.  It is hard drive installable and requires 4.5 MB of disk space.  Although it was initially released by Seven Hills Software, Jörg Kienzle made it available as shareware in 1996.
