Descrizione: The Aethra Chronicles - Volume One: Celystra's Bane or The Aethra Chronicles (also known as Aethra for short) is an MS-DOS role-playing video game released as shareware in 1994. The game is based on the Rolemaster game system, a Pencil & Paper role playing game. It was written - mostly as a one-man project - by Michael Lawrence with some help from others for the graphics and sound/music.
The first volume of the game is split into three chapters: The Book of Prophecy, Gems of Power, and Demons Might. The Book of Prophecy was freely distributed. The other two chapters could be purchased through information in the first chapter. Two additional volumes were planned, but not created.
