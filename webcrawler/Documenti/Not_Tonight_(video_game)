Titolo: Not Tonight (video game)

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Not Tonight is a role-playing adventure game by British studio PanicBarn, released for Microsoft Windows in August 2018, and for Nintendo Switch (as Not Tonight: Take Back Control Edition) on 31 January 2020, the actual date of United Kingdom leaving the European Union. Set in an alternate timeline shortly after the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union, the player takes the role of a citizen of European heritage who must survive under an authoritarian British government, working as a bouncer across various venues and earning enough to avoid deportation. Along the way, the player must make decisions on whether to change the course of events or remain complicit with the new administration.
A downloadable content game called Not Tonight: One Love was released for Steam on 25 June 2019; the DLC later came bundled up for the Take Back Control Edition at the time of the game's release.
A sequel, Not Tonight 2, was announced in August 2021, and it will be released sometime in 2022.
