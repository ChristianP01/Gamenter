Titolo: Links Extreme

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Links Extreme is a 1999 golf video game developed by Access Software and published by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows. It is the first game in the Links series to be published by Microsoft, which purchased Access Software a month prior to the game's release.
Links Extreme features unusual game modes and courses that are not common to the sport of golf. Critics felt that the game's concept was not handled well, and its small selection of two courses was particularly criticized.
