Titolo: Oh Shit!

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Oh Shit! is a Pac-Man clone released in 1985 for the MSX by The ByteBusters (Aackosoft's in-house development team) and published by Dutch publisher Aackosoft under the Classics range of games; a range that consists of clones of arcade games, i.e Scentipede being a clone of Atari's Centipede. Oh Shit!'s level and art design is identical to that of Pac-Man.Oh Shit! was later republished with differing names and cover art several times; Oh Shit! was renamed to Oh No! for the game's UK release due to the name being considered 'too obscene', and the name was shortened to Shit! for its release by Premium III Software Distribution. The European re-release Shit! notably uses cover art from 1985 horror novel The Howling III: Echoes, possibly without permission. Oh Shit! features digitized speech; when the player loses a life, the eponymous phrase "Oh Shit!" is said. For the renamed releases, Oh No! and Shit!, the speech is changed accordingly.
