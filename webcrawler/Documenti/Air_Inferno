Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Air Inferno is a 1990 flight simulation arcade video game developed and released by Taito, in Japan, Europe and North America. A spin-off from Taito's Landing series, Air Inferno is an aerial firefighting simulation that involves piloting a helicopter on various rescue missions, shooting a fire extinguisher to extinguish flames while rescuing civilians.Like its predecessor Top Landing (1988), Air Inferno used flat-shaded, 3D polygon graphics. Both games ran on the Taito Air System hardware, which used 68000 (12 MHz) and Z80 (4 MHz) microprocessors as CPU and a TMS320C25 (24 MHz) digital signal processor as GPU. The game comes in two types of arcade cabinets, a larger deluxe motion simulator cockpit cabinet and a smaller standard cockpit cabinet.
