Descrizione: Bakutotsu Kijūtei (爆突機銃艇, Bakutotsu Kijūtei, lit. "Bomb Thrust Machine Gun Vessel"), also known by its longer title as Bakutotsu Kijūtei: Baraduke II, is a scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1988 only in Japan, and for the Virtual Console in 2009. It runs on Namco System 1 hardware, and is the sequel to Baraduke, which was released three years earlier. It was also the second game from the company to allow scores not ending in "0" (the first was Hopping Mappy released in 1986), along with the first one to display Katakana in bold text onscreen to distinguish it from Hiragana. The game would later be ported to the Wii Virtual Console in 2009 for Japan only.
