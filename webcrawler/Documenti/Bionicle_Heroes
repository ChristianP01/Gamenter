Titolo: Bionicle Heroes

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Bionicle Heroes is a 2006 multi-platform video game published by Eidos Interactive and TT Games Publishing and based on Lego's Bionicle line of constructible action figures. The game was released in November 2006 on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Nintendo GameCube, Microsoft Windows, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS; a Nintendo Wii version was later released in April 2007. The home console and PC versions were developed by Traveller's Tales, while Amaze Entertainment developed the handheld versions. A version of the game for mobile phones, developed by Universomo, was also released. The home console and PC versions of the game are third-person shooters, while the Game Boy Advance version is a run 'n' gun shoot 'em up and the Nintendo DS version is a first-person shooter. The story of Bionicle Heroes, where the player seeks to liberate the island of Voya Nui and its inhabitants from the villainous Piraka, is not canon to the official Bionicle story.
Development for Bionicle Heroes began in 2005. Initially, the home console version was set to be a first-person shooter, but concerns over the game's potential Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rating led it to be shifted to a third-person perspective. The Nintendo DS version marked the first first-person shooter released on the platform since Metroid Prime Hunters earlier that year. The home console version received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the humour but found the gameplay to be simplistic and repetitive. The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions received more favorable reviews, being compared favorably to the Contra series and Metroid Prime Hunters, respectively.
