Descrizione: Chaos;Head (stylized as Ch√§oS;HEAd) is a 2008 science fiction visual novel video game developed by 5pb. and Nitroplus. It is the first game in the Science Adventure series. Following the original Microsoft Windows release, the enhanced version Chaos;Head Noah was released for Xbox 360 in 2009, and has since been ported to multiple platforms. The game follows Nishijo Takumi, who gets involved in the "New Gen" serial murder case. He frequently experiences delusions and hallucinations, some of which the player can influence, which affects the progression of the story.
The game was planned by Chiyomaru Shikura and written by Hayashi Naotaka, and features character designs by Sasaki Mutsumi and music by Takeshi Abo, who described the game's sound as "rainy". The game was commercially successful, helping 5pb. establish itself as a game developer, and was well received for its story. In addition to the direct sequel Chaos;Head Love Chu Chu! and the thematic sequel Chaos;Child, manga, an anime series, and an internet radio show based on Chaos;Head have been produced.
