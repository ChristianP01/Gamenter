Titolo: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014 video game)

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is an open world action-adventure video game based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man and the 2014 film of the same name. Developed by Beenox, it is the sequel to 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man, and takes place within the same continuity, different from that of the films. The game's plot expands upon that of the film by including additional characters and elements from the Spider-Man comic books and other aspects of the Marvel Universe.
The game was released on April 29 in North America and May 2 in Europe for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, and Xbox 360, to mixed to negative reviews. The Xbox One version was released alongside the other platforms digitally while the release of physical copies was delayed by two weeks. Gameloft also released a mobile version on April 17 for iOS and Android devices as a paid game. The game was also localized in Japan as a Sony-exclusive title. It is the last Spider-Man video game (and by extension, the final Marvel game) to be published by Activision (who lost the game publishing rights to multiple Marvel characters shortly after the game's release), and also the last major Spider-Man video game to be released for the non-Sony platforms, as the license for Spider-Man games was passed to Insomniac Games, who went on to develop the PlayStation-exclusive Marvel's Spider-Man series published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, beginning with the 2018 game Marvel's Spider-Man.
