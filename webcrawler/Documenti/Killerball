Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Killerball is a video game about a futuristic sport published by Micro√Øds in 1989 which blends American football with roller-skating, similar to the 1975 film Rollerball. This violent game is played in a circular rink where each 5-man team tries to score by putting the ball into the hole of the opposing team on the opposite sides of the track. Taking the ball from an opponent can only be done by knocking him down.
