Descrizione: Lemonade Tycoon, first released as Lemonade Inc., is a Shockwave-based game. A free, limited version is available for online play at many sites or the full version with no time restrictions can be purchased online.
The goal of Lemonade Tycoon is to sell lemonade for profit. The last update (1.1.9) was renamed Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe. In 2009, Electronic Arts published an iPhone version of Lemonade Tycoon.  Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition is also available on Mac OS X, published by MacPlay.While selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices, and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as  long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. The game allows players to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to continue.
Lemonade Tycoon has similarities to Lemonade Stand, a computer game originally created for the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium in 1973 and later ported by Apple Computer for use with its then-new Apple II platform in 1979. The game also required players to make businesses decisions based upon weather, customers, and cost/availability of stock.
