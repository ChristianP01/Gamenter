Descrizione: Dream Chamber is a point-and-click adventure game, in the third person, for iPhone, iPad, Microsoft Windows, Mac, Android, developed by DarkWave Games and published by Anuman under their Micro√Øds brand. The first episode, developed with Unity, was released worldwide via digital channels on 24 October 2013.
The game is set in the America of the Thirties, characterized by Prohibition and Great Depression. The player must assume the role of Charlie Chamber, a rich and bored inheritor spending his time with the social obligations of the smart society, as well as with his hobby of being a private detective. Although he is no professional, Charlie has an advantage: while dreaming he can go back to the places he visited, finding new clues which he had perceived only subliminally while awake. Moreover, while dreaming Charlie is able to face his own subconscious, embodied by Charles. The game goal is to solve the cases investigated by Charlie.
Dream Chamber is intended as entertainment with an artistic value: the developer has declared that all the artwork has been hand-drawn and the soundtrack, a mix of swing and jazz pieces, is fully original, recorded in a studio.
The story, the setting and the style draw on the noir/hardboiled fiction genre, played in an ironic key, mostly through the features of the main character.
Dream Chamber is dubbed in English and subtitled in English, Italian, French, Spanish and German.
