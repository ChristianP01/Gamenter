Descrizione: Gururin is a puzzle arcade video game developed by Face, with the assistance of Minato Giken, and originally published by SNK on May 25, 1994. It was the first game to be created by Face for the Neo Geo platform and it was not released on the Neo Geo AES (home).
In the game, players must match 3 people with their respective colored outfit, while rotating the playfield in order to rearrange them. Though it was initially only launched for the Neo Geo MVS (arcade), Gururin was later re-released by HAMSTER Corporation through download services for various consoles in 2018. A conversion for the Neo Geo CD was planned and even previewed but it did not receive an official release to the public.
Gururin has garnered mixed critical reception since its original release in arcades from reviewers who felt mixed towards several aspects of the game such as the visuals, sound design and gameplay, while its difficulty and learning curve has been heavily criticized.
