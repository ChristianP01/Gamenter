Titolo: Avalon: The Legend Lives

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Avalon: The Legend Lives is a text-based online multi-player role-playing game world that was first released on 28 October 1989 at the gaming convention Adventure 89. It has maintained a continuous on-line presence with consistent and intact persona files and player history since the late 1980s, rendering it the longest continuously running on-line role-playing game in history.While it follows closely in the tradition of many early multi-user dungeons, Avalon offered many features that have since become signature components of the role-playing game genre: Real economies, distinct ecosystems and weather effects, Gods with followers and priests, player housing and autonomous governments, and skill-based real time player vs player (PvP) combat, and a warfare system.
Within Avalon, players are offered the opportunity to "live another life"; to fully immerse themselves in the gameworld â€” a world of merchants, thieves, princes, gods, dragons, and more. It is a game where its history and narrative can be decided, in part, by the players themselves.
