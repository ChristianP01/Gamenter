Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Armored Core 3 is a 2002 third-person shooter mecha video game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 2. It is the sixth entry in the Armored Core series. Armored Core 3 acts as a reboot for the franchise and begins a storyline that would continue through Armored Core: Last Raven. In 2009, Armored Core 3 was ported to the PlayStation Portable.
As a reboot of the franchise, Armored Core 3 returns the setting back to the post-apocalyptic setting of the earlier PlayStation trilogy. The player is a mercenary in a future where humanity has been driven underground and is ruled by a powerful artificial intelligence called The Controller. Despite The Controller's rule, corporations fight each other for dominance.
Armored Core 3 is largely unchanged from its predecessor. Players operate mech units that they may customize with credits earned from completing missions and fighting in an arena. Customization extends to every aspect of a player's Armored Core unit, including the individual parts, weapons, paint, and emblem. Local multiplayer modes allow for up to 4 players to fight each other with their custom Armored Cores.
