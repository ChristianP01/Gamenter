Descrizione: Franko: The Crazy Revenge is a side-scrolling beat 'em up computer game developed by the Polish Szczecin-based studio World Software for the Commodore Amiga in 1994 (using AMOS), later ported to DOS in 1996. It follows the titular Franko causing mayhem on the streets of Szczecin to avenge his fallen friend Alex.
One of the earlier Polish commercially released video games, it also attained quite a notoriety with the amount of violence (being possibly the first violent Polish video game), use of sampled Polish profanity,  nudity (with one of the enemy types in the later level being coat flashers) and with how much detail have it portrayed urban Poland in the early 1990s. Gry Online felt the game was Poland's answer to contemporary titles like Double Dragon or Golden Axe. Upon release it was widely hyped within the Polish video game press and has since enjoys a cult following in its country of origin, being praised for atmosphere and the portrayal of the Polish realias despite the technical and artistic ineptitude. A sequel, Skinny & Franko: Fists of Violence was announced in 2014 and is slated for release in 2021.
