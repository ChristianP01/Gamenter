Titolo: JellyCar

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: JellyCar (originally known as JelloCar) is the first in a series of driving and platforming video games developed by Tim FitzRandolph and released under the pseudonym Walaber. Initially released independently through Xbox Live Indie Games and later ported to devices using Apple's iOS operating system, JellyCar requires players to drive a car across a two-dimensional landscape while maintaining balance by means of (in the case of platforms on which it is supported) accelerometers. The game features soft body physics that give it its distinctive gameplay and style. The series has since been picked up by FitzRandolph's current employer, Disney Interactive Studios, which has released sequels to the game for multiple platforms.
