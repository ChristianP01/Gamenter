Descrizione: Hitman: Codename 47 is a stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Eidos Interactive. It was released exclusively for Microsoft Windows in November 2000. It is the debut title in the Hitman franchise. Gameplay is presented from a third-person perspective, and revolves around assassinating targets in a stealthy fashion by using disguises and suppressed weaponry, though some levels are more action-focused and do not feature stealth as a possibility. Players control Agent 47, a genetically enhanced human clone who is rigorously trained in methods of murder. Upon escaping from his testing facility, 47 is hired by the International Contract Agency (ICA), a global contract killing organisation. His missions take him to locations in Asia, Europe, and South America to assassinate wealthy and decadent criminals with seemingly no connections between them, until it is revealed that they were all involved in 47's creation.
Codename 47 received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the unique approach to stealth gameplay, but criticized its difficulty and controls. The game sold over 500,000 units by 2009. A sequel, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, was released in 2002.
