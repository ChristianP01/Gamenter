Titolo: ESPN SpeedWorld (video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: ESPN SpeedWorld is a Super NES and Sega Genesis video game that was released in 1994 exclusively for North America based on the television series of the same name. The title screen of the video game was partially inspired by the 1993 running of the First Union 400 racing event; which occurred on April 18, 1993. The real-life drivers from the mid-1990s are missing because the game only has an ESPN license and not an official NASCAR license.
