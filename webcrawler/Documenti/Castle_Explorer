The Vancouver Sun described it as "compelling, fascinating and informative". Geet Out UK thought it "wove RP and intrigue into the educational content". Feibel said it was "Elaborate, exciting, informative. Mandatory!". Sun Sentinel said the educational content was let down by poor gameplay. Meanwhile, a book that explored the series felt it was a good mix of the two.
