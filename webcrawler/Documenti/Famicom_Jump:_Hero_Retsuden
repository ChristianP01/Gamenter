The game commemorates the 20th anniversary of Shueisha's manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump.
The game is set in a world that brings together many of the long-running titles, which include stories of the past and present at the time of their release, that had appeared in the magazine.  The game consists of a main character wandering and encountering the many Jump heroes as they try to save the world from an alliance of many of the most powerful and evil of the Jump villains.
The game sold 1.1 million cartridges for the Famicom in Japan. It was the first title in the Jump video game series. It had a sequel, Famicom Jump II: Saikyō no Shichinin. Due to it being based on a magazine specifically localized for the Japanese market, the game was never released outside Japan.
