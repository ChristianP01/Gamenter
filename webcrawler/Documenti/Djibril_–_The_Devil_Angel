Titolo: Djibril – The Devil Angel

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Djibril The Devil Angel (魔界天使ジブリール, Makai Tenshi Jiburīru (Makai Tenshi Djibril)) is a eroge visual novel series created by Frontwing composed of the classic entries and one spinoff, titled MegaChu. Each of the entries have also spawned trimmed down erotic OVA releases, which enjoyed mild popularity in the west. This series is created by Kūchū Yōsai and produced by Noboru Yamaguchi.
The game series also won a Bishōjo Game Award on September 5, 2008, as part of the best game series ever. The first two games were rereleased in 2008 due to a problem with DirectX 10 and the video playback software, causing Front Wing to standardize all three games released that year with the same engine, which removed compatibility with Windows 98 and Me. Makai Tenshi Djibril 4, the beginning of a new saga based at a school seemingly founded by Luvriel for Devil Angels, was released on April 23, 2010, and used, for the first time, graphics displayed in native 576i HD.
For the 2011 game, instead of Djibril The Devil Angel 5, the game is called Djibril The Angels Of The Warring States (戦国天使ジブリール, Sengoku Tenshi Jiburīru (Sengoku Tenshi Djibril)), and features all six of the main characters from Djibril Episode 1 to 4 as if they are from the Sengoku period of Japan, the last game produced by Noboru Yamaguchi before his death.
In early 2020, Frontwing announced a sixth game, in conjunction with DMM Games, starring a new cast of angels, titled Djibril The Angels Of Cyberspace (電脳天使ジブリール, Dennou Tenshi Jiburīru (Dennou Tenshi Djibril)), with a cyberspace theme, with the only characters confirmed returning from the first four games being Luvriel and Rika Manabe. This is also the only game in the series with a partially censored version.
