Titolo: Konami 80's Arcade Gallery

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Konami 80's AC Special (known in Japan as Konami 80's Arcade Gallery (コナミエイティーズアーケードギャラリー, Konami Eitizu Ākēdo Gyararī) is a compilation of arcade video games, originally released in arcades in 1998. It was later ported to the PlayStation in 1999, where it was renamed to Konami Arcade Classics for its North American release. Unlike most of Konami's PlayStation games, the PlayStation version was not released in PAL regions.
While many compilations on home consoles predate Konami Arcade Classics, it is one of the earliest examples of an arcade reissue of classic games, being preceded only by the Namco Classics Collection series. It is also, to date, one of only two arcade compilations with both a coin-op and consumer release (the other being Space Invaders Anniversary, which was only released in Japan and Europe).
