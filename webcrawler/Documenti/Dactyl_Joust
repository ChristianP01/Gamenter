Titolo: Dactyl Joust

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Dactyl Joust is an unreleased action-platform video game that was in development by High Voltage Software and planned to be published by Atari Corporation on a scheduled November 1995 release date exclusively for both the Atari Jaguar and the Atari Jaguar CD add-on. It was intended to be a remake of John Newcomer's 1982 arcade game Joust, where players take control of a knight riding a pterodactyl, instead of a flying ostrich, on a first-person perspective battling and defeating groups of enemy knights riding dactyls. The game formed part of a partnership deal between Atari Corp. and Williams Entertainment that included plans to update and release some of the latter's early arcade games for the Jaguar platform.
