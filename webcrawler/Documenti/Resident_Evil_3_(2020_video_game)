Titolo: Resident Evil 3 (2020 video game)

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Resident Evil 3 is a 2020 survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom. Released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, it is a remake of the 1999 game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. The game follows former elite agent Jill Valentine and mercenary Carlos Oliveira as they attempt to find a vaccine and escape from a city during a viral outbreak. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective and requires the player to solve puzzles and defeat a variety of monsters while being pursued by a creature called Nemesis.
Most of Resident Evil 3 was developed concurrently with the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 and both games run on Capcom's proprietary RE Engine. Although the game features the same premise as the original, many parts were rearranged in favor of a more focused story. To honor the more action-oriented approach of the original, developers revamped the movement speed and animations from the Resident Evil 2 remake and added an ability for players to dodge incoming attacks. Because some features from the original game were excluded, a separate online multiplayer game, Resident Evil: Resistance, was bundled with Resident Evil 3.
Resident Evil 3 received generally favorable reviews from critics, who highlighted its compelling narrative, tense atmosphere, and graphics. Criticism was primarily targeted at the game's short length and missing features from the original. The game's larger emphasis on moment-to-moment action and scripted sequences also disappointed some critics. According to Capcom, the game had sold 4.6 million copies by November 2021.
