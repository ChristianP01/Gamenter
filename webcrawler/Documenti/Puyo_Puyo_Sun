Titolo: Puyo Puyo Sun

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Puyo Puyo Sun (ぷよぷよSUN, Puyopuyo San) is the third installment of the Puyo Puyo games series, and the sequel to Puyo Puyo 2, made in 1996 by Compile. After the highly acclaimed success of its predecessor, Compile took a slightly more retro approach, so players had a more original feel to the game over that of 2.
The name of Puyo Puyo Sun comes from a Japanese pun on san, and also indicates a new Puyo brought into the game. As Sun Puyo were used in this game, and the game itself is not only set on a tropical beach, but is the third in the series (san (三) is the Japanese word for the number three), the name served multiple purposes.
Puyo Puyo Sun was also released for the PC. This version was also translated into Korean, so it is the only official translation of the game in any language other than Japanese.
