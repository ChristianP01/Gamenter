Titolo: NHLPA Hockey '93

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: NHLPA Hockey '93 is a Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System ice hockey game developed by Park Place Productions and published by Electronic Arts Sports Network. It is the second installment of the NHL series and the first to be released for the Super NES.
Although considered to be the second EA Sports NHL game, the game was not licensed by the NHL; however, it did receive licensing permission from the NHLPA. Because of this, all teams are referred to only by city (the New York Islanders were referred to as "Long Island") with no use of the team name itself. Additionally, no NHL team logos or NHL emblems are seen anywhere in the game.
