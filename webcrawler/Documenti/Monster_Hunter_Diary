Descrizione: Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airou Village (モンハン日記 ぽかぽかアイルー村, Monhan Nikki Poka Poka Airū Mura) is a spin-off installment in the Monster Hunter series, developed by FromSoftware and published by Capcom for the PlayStation Portable. It was released in Japan on August 26, 2010. The word airou (アイルー, airū) is the Japanese equivalent of felyne (Ailuro is the Greek word for cat), a fictional sapient cat species that appears in the Monster Hunter games.  The player gives orders to the felynes to progress to the end of quests instead of having direct control over them. The game uses a more cartoonish art style as opposed to the more realistic style seen in the main Monster Hunter games. More emphasis is placed on style and village management. A few Hello Kitty items are also available in the game.
