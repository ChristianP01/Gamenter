Titolo: Borderline (video game)

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Borderline (ボーダーライン, Bōdārain) is a vertically scrolling shooter-maze game released by Sega as an arcade game in 1981. The player controls a jeep and has to destroy enemy refineries. There are four stages with different gameplay. The first stage plays like a vertically scrolling shooter. In the second stage, the player maneuvers his Jeep through underbrush, and enemies can only follow on its path, a concept later found in Namco's Dig Dug (1982).
Borderline was reissued later in the year with slightly altered graphics as Star Raker. Borderline was later a launch game for the SG-1000 in 1983. It was also converted for the Atari 2600 under the name Thunderground, released by Sega's home division; it was one of the last games Sega released as a third-party developer for Atari. The SG-1000 and Atari 2600 ports received positive reviews from critics.
