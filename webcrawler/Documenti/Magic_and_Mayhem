Titolo: Magic and Mayhem

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Magic & Mayhem (working title: Duel: The Mage Wars), known in Europe as Mana, is a fantasy/mythology-themed real-time strategy game designed by Julian Gollop and developed by Mythos Games. It was published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment (European release) in late 1998, and by Bethesda (North American release) soon after in 1999. Although the game received generally positive criticisms, it met a quiet public reception.
Magic and Mayhem was designed by Gollop as the next incarnation of his successful Chaos video game concept, involving the same mythical wizard combat. Like in Chaos, the player assumes the role of a wizard that can cast spells and summon creatures in order to defeat the other wizards in the battle.
In the single-player campaign, the player assumes the role of Cornelius, a young magician who yearns to become his uncle Lucan's apprentice. He arrives at Lucan's home shortly after graduation from the Hermetic Academy and eager to begin his study, only to find his uncle gone and the home in ruins.
A sequel, The Art of Magic: Magic and Mayhem, was released in October 2001 for Windows.
