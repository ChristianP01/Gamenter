Titolo: Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is an adventure game developed and published by LucasArts in 1991. A sequel to 1990's The Secret of Monkey Island, it is the second game in the Monkey Island series. It was the sixth LucasArts game to use the SCUMM engine, and the first game to use the iMUSE sound system. In it, pirate Guybrush Threepwood searches for the legendary treasure of Big Whoop and again faces off against the pirate LeChuck, who is now a zombie.
The development team for Monkey Island 2 was largely the same as for The Secret of Monkey Island. The project was led by Ron Gilbert, who was again joined by Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. The game was a critical success, but a commercial failure. By the time another sequel was released six years later, Gilbert, Schafer, and Grossman had all left LucasArts. Future installments in the series were developed by different creative teams, and used different artistic and gameplay styles. A "Special Edition" remake of Monkey Island 2 was released in 2010, following a similar remake of the first game.
