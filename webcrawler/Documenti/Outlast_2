Descrizione: Outlast 2 (stylized as OUâ¸¸LASTII) is a first-person psychological horror survival video game developed and published by Red Barrels. It's the sequel to the 2013 video game Outlast, and features a journalist named Blake Langermann, along with his wife Lynn, roaming the Arizona desert to explore the murder of a pregnant woman only known as Jane Doe. Both get separated in a helicopter crash, and Blake has to find his wife while traveling through a village inhabited by a deranged sect that believes the end of days are upon them.
Shortly after the release and popularity of Outlast, Red Barrels announced the sequel. A gameplay demo was then released at both PAX East and E3 2016 on April 22 and June 15 respectively, with a release originally slated for Autumn 2016. Due to development delays, the game was ultimately released on April 25, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The Nintendo Switch version released on March 27, 2018 on the Nintendo eShop.
The game was met with generally positive reception upon release, with praise going towards the graphics, sound design, and atmosphere. Criticisms were reserved for the general story, context sensitive gameplay design, amount of gore, and difficulty.
A third installment in the series, entitled The Outlast Trials, is set to be released in 2022.
