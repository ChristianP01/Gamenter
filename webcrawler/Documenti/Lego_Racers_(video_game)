Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Lego Racers is a Lego-themed racing video game developed by High Voltage Software and published by Lego Media.Set in the fictional "Legoland" universe, the single-player mode follows various minifigure characters competing in a racing competition created by a fictional racing champion called Rocket Racer. Players control a minifigure, allowing them to drive a variety of cars built out of Lego and race them against other minifigure characters. Items can be used by the player to hinder other racers' progress, and the player can create their own cars and characters with unlocked Lego bricks and use them to race. A local multiplayer mode also allows multiple players to race against each other.
Originally conceived by High Voltage founder Kerry J. Ganofsky, creative expertise from The Lego Group assisted High Voltage in the game's development after Lego Media agreed to begin production. It received mixed reviews from critics, who were divided on the game's graphics, construction system, driving gameplay and other design aspects. Two sequels developed by Attention to Detail, called Lego Racers 2 and Drome Racers, were released in 2001 and 2002, respectively.
