Titolo: Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales is a platform video game developed by Imagitec Design and published by Atari Corporation exclusively for the Atari Jaguar in North America on December 9, 1994, then in Europe on January 1995 and later in Japan by Messe Sansao on July of the same year. It is the third entry in the Bubsy franchise, which is preceded by Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and Bubsy 2. The title itself is a word play in reference to Fractured Fairy Tales, a segment from the animated television series The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends.
When all of the fairy tales suddenly become corrupted, Bubsy is now tasked on venturing through Fairytaleland and fixing them in order to protect all of the children in the world from these altered stories. Originally planned and advertised to be a port of the first entry in the series as part of a deal with Accolade for the Jaguar, Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales later became its own original title during development, while retaining all the gameplay elements from the original game.Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales received mixed reception since its release. While some critics praised the game's graphics, music and difficulty, others panned the controls, camera, level design, voice acting and personality of the main character. Reviewers also criticized the game for its lack of use of the hardware and compared it to the previous 16-bit iterations. By April 1, 1995, the game had sold less than 9,000 copies, though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime. The series continued with Bubsy 3D, which was released in 1996 for the PlayStation. Retrospective reviews for the title have been equally mixed in recent years.
