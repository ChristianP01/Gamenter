Descrizione: Beatmania IIDX 6th Style is the sixth game in the beatmania IIDX series of music video games released in arcades by Konami in 2001 and features 40 new songs. 6th Style introduced new features such as letter grades (ranging from F to AAA) and the new hard mode (which removes the usual 80% lifebar requirement but makes the lifebar itself stricter).
The interface used by 6th Style is more modern looking than previous styles. The arcade version also switched the background movies to use a DVD instead of a VCD. 6th Style also introduced the current font design for the judgement labels.
