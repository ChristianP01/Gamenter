Titolo: Koronis Rift

Anno: 1985

Descrizione: Koronis Rift is a 1985 computer game from Lucasfilm Games.  It was produced and designed by Noah Falstein. Originally developed for the Atari 8-bit family and the Commodore 64, Koronis Rift was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, MSX, Tandy Color Computer 3, and ZX Spectrum.
The Atari and C64 version shipped on a flippy disk, with one version of the game on each side.  A cassette version was also released for the Commodore 64.  The Atari version required computers with the GTIA chip installed in order to display properly.
Koronis Rift was one of two games in Lucasfilm Games' second wave (December 1985). The other was The Eidolon. Both enhanced the fractal technology developed for Rescue on Fractalus!. In Koronis Rift, the Atari 8-bit family's additional colors (over those of the Commodore 64) allowed the programmers to gradually fade in the background rather than it suddenly popping in as in Rescue, an early example of depth cueing in a computer game.
