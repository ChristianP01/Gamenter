Titolo: The Worm in Paradise

Anno: 1985

Descrizione: The Worm in Paradise was the third and final video game in the Silicon Dreams trilogy, a series of text adventure games featuring the player in the character of "Kim Kimberly". It is the sequel to Snowball and Return to Eden. Worm in Paradise takes place generations after the first two games, when the planet Eden has been colonised. The player is an ordinary citizen in Eden's most populous city, Enoch. The game was noteworthy for quite a bit of social commentary relative to other games of the same genre and era. The game clearly drew quite a bit of inspiration from the novel 1984.
