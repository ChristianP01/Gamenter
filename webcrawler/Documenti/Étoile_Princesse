Titolo: Étoile Princesse

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Étoile Princesse is an action role-playing video game developed and published by Exact exclusively for the Sharp X68000 in Japan on March 26, 1993. It is the third title to be created and released by Exact for the X68000 platform late into its commercial life span, which was a few months before being discontinued in the same year by Sharp Corporation.
Taking place in the fantasy world of Fail Land, the players take control of young princess Rilule on a journey to rescue the kidnapped female magicians of her country as well as a young man named Sol from their captivity by a dark witch and her demonic followers, who have invaded and terrorized upon the inhabitants of the floating land masses, in order to save her kingdom from peril. Its gameplay mainly consists of action RPG combining exploration, platforming and shoot 'em up elements, with a main two-button configuration.
Despite its late release on the computer, Étoile Princesse proved to be one of the most popular titles from Exact among the X68000 userbase with its colorful graphics, sound design and gameplay that would eventually lead it to being nominated for a "Game of the Year" award by Japanese magazine Oh!X, before ultimately losing against other titles on the system. After its release, Exact would go on to develop their fourth and last title for the X68000; Geograph Seal, which was released a year later to equally positive critical and audience response.
