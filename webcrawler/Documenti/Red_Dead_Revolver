Titolo: Red Dead Revolver

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Red Dead Revolver is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. It is the first entry in the Red Dead series, and was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in May 2004. Set in the 1880s, during the American frontier, the single-player story follows bounty hunter Red Harlow's quest for revenge after the murder of his parents. A local multiplayer mode allows up to two players to face off against each other or AI-controlled bots in free-for-all battles. 
Rockstar San Diego (then known as Angel Studios) began work on Red Dead Revolver with Capcom's funding in 2000. During the development, Angel Studios was acquired and rebranded by Rockstar Games. After Yoshiki Okamoto left Capcom in 2003, Red Dead Revolver was canceled until Rockstar Games acquired the rights to the game and revived it later that year. The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and sold moderately well. A spiritual successor, Red Dead Redemption, was released in May 2010, and a third game, Red Dead Redemption 2, was released in October 2018.
