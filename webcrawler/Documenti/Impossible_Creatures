Descrizione: Impossible Creatures is a steampunk real-time strategy game released in 2003 and developed by Relic Entertainment in conjunction with Microsoft Studios. Its unique feature is that the armies used are all created by the player. Inspired by the works of H. G. Wells, the armies consist of 9 creatures; each one is a combination of any two animals from a list of 76 (51 with no downloads). Many animals possess inherent abilities to add more strategic depth to the game. There is an extensive single-player campaign as well as online multiplayer functionality with different game modes, add-ons, custom maps, mods, and scenarios.
Impossible Creatures was followed up later by a free downloadable expansion entitled Insect Invasion which added new creatures and abilities to the game. The last official add on for Impossible Creatures was released in 2004.
