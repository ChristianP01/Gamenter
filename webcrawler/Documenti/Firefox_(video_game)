Titolo: Firefox (video game)

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Firefox is a 1984 shoot 'em up arcade game based on the 1982 Clint Eastwood movie of the same name.  It was produced in 1984 as Atari, Inc.'s only LaserDisc video game. Like Atari's first-person Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, Firefox came as both an upright and sit down cabinet with a yoke style controller.
To develop the laserdisc footage, two developers, Mike Hally and Moe Shore, sifted through miles of footage from the film, amounting to 20 to 30 hours' worth. Most of the resulting footage was first-person shots filmed from helicopters flying over Greenland and Scandinavia.
