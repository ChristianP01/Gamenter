Descrizione: Immercenary is a 1995 role-playing shooter video game developed by Five Miles Out and published by Electronic Arts in North America and Japan exclusively for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Set in 2004, players assume the role of PIC (Project for Intertemporal Communication) operative number five tasked with shutting down the operating system Perfect1, which trapped all humanity into the Garden core of the Perfect virtual reality network. Its gameplay mainly consists of first-person shooter action mixed with role-playing game elements.
