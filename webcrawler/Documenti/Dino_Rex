Titolo: Dino Rex

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Dino Rex is a fighting arcade video game developed and originally released by Taito in Japan on November 1992. Set during the 25th century BC on a prehistoric South America, players assume the role of a warrior commanding his dinosaur companion as he enters a tournament held by the current titular king in order to become the next ruler while facing matches against other rivals. Its gameplay consists of one-on-one fights, with a main three-button configuration, featuring special moves and combo techniques.
Produced under the working title "Project D-Rex", Dino Rex was created by most of the same team behind Gun Frontier and Metal Black, including director Takatsuna Senba and was originally intended to be a shoot 'em up game but it was instead retooled into a fighting title due to the success of games like Capcom's 1991 Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. It is notable for using stop motion animation for each of its dinosaur fighters, predating Atari Games' 1994 Primal Rage two years prior. Initially launched for the arcades, it was later re-released only in Japan under the compilation for PlayStation 2 titled Taito Memories II J≈çkan on 25 January 2007.Dino Rex has been met with negative reception from reviewers since its release, who criticized aspects such as the visuals, controls and difficulty.
