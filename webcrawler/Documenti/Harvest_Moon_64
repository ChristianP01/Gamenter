Descrizione: Harvest Moon 64, released in Japan as Bokujō Monogatari 2 (牧場物語2), is a farm simulation video game developed and published by Victor Interactive Software for the Nintendo 64 video game console, and the third game in the Story of Seasons series (following Harvest Moon GB). It was released in Japan on February 5, 1999, and in North America by Natsume on December 22, 1999.Natsume initially stated bringing it to Wii U Virtual Console was not possible due to technical issues, despite the Wii proving the task to be possible through homebrew emulation. However, in celebration of the series' twentieth anniversary, the game saw release on the Wii U Virtual Console on February 23, 2017. This also marked the game's debut in the PAL regions (the original had been cancelled due to time constraints), as well as the game's first official re-release (as well as the first time digital) in nearly two decades.
