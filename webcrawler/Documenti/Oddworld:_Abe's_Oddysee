Descrizione: Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is a platform video game developed by Oddworld Inhabitants and published by GT Interactive. It was released in 1997 for the PlayStation game console, and computers running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. Emulated versions for the PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network were released in 2009, 2010, and 2013.
The game centers on the eponymous Abe, a meek Mudokon slave at the RuptureFarms meat processing factory. When he discovers that he and his fellow Mudokons are to be slaughtered to make a new product, Abe decides to escape and liberate as many enslaved Mudokons as he can. The player assumes the role of Abe as he attempts a perilous quest to emancipate his downtrodden people.
Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee was widely acclaimed for having innovative gameplay, good art direction and engaging cutscenes; however, its difficult learning curve and system of only saving at checkpoints received criticism. It was the first game in the planned five-part Oddworld series, which includes the direct sequels Abe's Exoddus (1998), Munch's Oddysee (2001) and Stranger's Wrath (2005). A remake of the game, titled Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty!, was developed by Just Add Water and released in 2014.
