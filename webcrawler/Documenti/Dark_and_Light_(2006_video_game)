Titolo: Dark and Light (2006 video game)

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Dark and Light was a pay to play fantasy MMORPG developed in Reunion Island by NPCube and published by Farlan Entertainment. It was released on June 6, 2006, to largely negative reviews. Though there was never an official announcement regarding discontinuation of service, the servers have been offline since 2008, ostensibly due to a lawsuit by VWORLD, LLC.
Snail Games acquired the rights to Dark and Light in 2008 and developed a "fantasy survival sandbox RPG", which was released as early access in 2017 with the same name.
