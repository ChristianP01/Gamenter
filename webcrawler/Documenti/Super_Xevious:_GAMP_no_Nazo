Titolo: Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo is a 1986 vertical-scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Namco for the Family Computer in Japan. It is the sequel to Xevious, a popular arcade game from 1983, and the fourth installment in the Xevious franchise overall. The player controls a spaceship named the Solvalou in its mission to destroy a powerful supercomputer named GAMP, which took over Earth during an ice age. GAMP no Nazo features a heavy focus on puzzle-solving, with each of the game's 21 levels posing a puzzle that must be solved to progress.
Created in response to the overwhelming success of the Family Computer port of Xevious, GAMP no Nazo was not designed by Masanobu Endo, the creator of the original game. Endo, who left Namco in 1985 to form Game Studio, opposed the idea of a sequel to his creation, as he felt it was unnecessary. Though they share a similar title and gameplay, GAMP no Nazo is not the same as the arcade game Super Xevious.
GAMP no Nazo was a commercial failure, and its changes to the gameplay of the original received backlash from fans. Critics disliked the difficulty level for being too high and its usage of secrets for being poorly-implemented and overly-complex. This led to a rethinking of the series' direction, with future Xevious sequels omitting many of GAMP no Nazo's design choices. The game was re-released for the Nintendo Vs. System arcade game hardware in 1987, and through the Namco Museum Archives Vol. 2 collection in 2020.
