Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Flying Nightmares is a flight simulator published by Domark for the Power Macintosh running classic Mac OS. It was a port of the almost identical IBM PC version, SVGA Harrier. It was one of the first commercial PPC native games. It was later ported to the 3DO by Lifelike Productions.
Released on Compact Disk, it was notable for having a 10 MB introduction video that was not based on actual in-game footage, while the game itself was only 3 MB and was based on SVGA graphics ported from the PC.
