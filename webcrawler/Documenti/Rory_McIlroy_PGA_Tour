Titolo: Rory McIlroy PGA Tour

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is a sports video game developed by EA Tiburon and published by Electronic Arts for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is an entry in the EA Sports PGA Tour franchise, and was the first series since 1999 not to feature Tiger Woods as its namesake, replacing him with Rory McIlroy.
The game was re-built from scratch as part of its shift to eighth generation consoles, adopting DICE's Frostbite 3 engine (primarily used for the Battlefield franchise) due to its graphical fidelity and ability to handle courses as large-scale maps (as opposed to having an individual map for each hole). Additionally, the game introduces new swing modes and assists, Golf Channel personalities and in-game presentation, and an arcade-style challenge mode.
Rory McIlroy PGA Tour received mixed reviews; although critics acknowledged the game's increased graphics quality and realism over previous installments in the franchise, the game was criticized primarily for its regressions over previous entries in the franchise, including a small number of available courses on launch, and the removal of various modes and features that had been present in previous PGA Tour games (however, additional courses, and some of these missing features, were added back in subsequent updates).
