Titolo: Oolite (video game)

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Oolite is a free and open source 3D space trading and combat simulator in the spirit of Elite. It is, as the name suggests, Object Oriented [E]lite, written in Objective-C.  Among Oolite's several similarities to its source, the gaming experience is enhanced by the context set in Elite's original manual, and the accompanying novella, The Dark Wheel. Oolite is licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later for the source code, while resources (pictures, music, textures, models) are dual-licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later and CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0.
