Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Breakout 2000 is an action video game developed by MP Games and published by Telegames exclusively for the Atari Jaguar on December 9, 1996. Part of Atari Corp.'s 2000 series, it is a remake of the 1976 arcade game Breakout, which spawned an entire genre of Breakout clones with its concept, such as Taito's 1986 arcade game Arkanoid. It is also one of the last licensed releases for the Jaguar, after it was discontinued in 1996 by Atari Corporation, who merged with JT Storage in a reverse takeover prior to the game's launch.Featuring the same gameplay premise as with the original Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen while a ball spawned by the player's paddle travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed but the player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, players have to move the paddle left and right to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.
Breakout 2000 received mildly positive reception from the few video game magazines and dedicated outlets that reviewed the game when it launched, with critics praising the graphics, control, gameplay and two-player mode but others were divided in the audio department.
