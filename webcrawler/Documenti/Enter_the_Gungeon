Descrizione: Enter the Gungeon is a bullet hell roguelike video game developed by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital.

The game follows four adventurers as they descend into the titular Gungeon (a firearms-themed dungeon) to find a gun that has the power to kill their past. The game presents procedurally-generated levels to the player, where they fight enemies and acquire new guns and items with unique abilities and effects through their journey.
There is a spin-off, Exit the Gungeon, which uses a platform game-approach instead of the top-down dungeon crawler.
