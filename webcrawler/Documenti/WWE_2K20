Descrizione: WWE 2K20 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K Sports. It was released worldwide on October 22, 2019, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is the twenty-first game in the WWE game series and the seventh under the WWE 2K banner. The sequel to WWE 2K19, 2K20 is the first game in the series not to be developed by Yuke's, which developed every entry in the series since its inception in 2000. They were replaced by Visual Concepts, who had previously worked with Yuke's as co-developers since 2014.
WWE 2K20 received negative reviews, with critics noting a regression in quality compared to its predecessor. The game has since gained notoriety in both the wrestling and gaming community for its many bugs at launch and technical issues. The backlash towards the game resulted in 2K pushing back the sequel by over two years and cancelling a planned sequel titled WWE 2K21. The follow-up title WWE 2K22, will be released in March 2022.
