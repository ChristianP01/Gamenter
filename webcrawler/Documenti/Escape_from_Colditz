Titolo: Escape from Colditz

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Escape from Colditz is a strategy card and dice-based board game produced by Gibsons Games of London and first released in 1973. The original game box features escape equipment on the lid and has a four section, black plastic internal game items tray. It was licensed to Parker Brothers in the US in the mid-1970s. The game was co-devised by successful escaper Pat Reid, based on the prisoner-of-war camp (Oflag IV-C) at Colditz Castle in Germany during World War II. The castle was built by the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony from 1694 to 1793, Augustus The Strong, upon ruins resulting from the Hussite Wars (1419 â€“ 1434). The castle's original name was 'Koldyeze', from the Teutonic or Saxon tongue.
