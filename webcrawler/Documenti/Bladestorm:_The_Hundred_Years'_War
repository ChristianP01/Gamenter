Descrizione: Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War is a historical real-time tactics video game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. It was published by Koei and developed by Omega Force. An enhanced expansion remake, entitled Bladestorm: Nightmare was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in Japan on January 29, 2015, and a couple of months later in the rest of the world. The worldwide Microsoft Windows release was on May 29, 2015. The game is loosely based on the Hundred Years' War between the Kingdoms of England and France in the 14th and 15th centuries. Just like the Kessen and Musou series from Koei, certain liberties are taken from the original history. For example, unlike what happened in real life, it is possible to save Joan of Arc from being burned at the stake. The Nightmare edition features creatures like dragons and goblins in an alternate storyline.
