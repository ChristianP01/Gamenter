Descrizione: Maou Golvellius (魔王ゴルベリアス, lit. "Devil Golvellius")  is an action role-playing video game developed by Compile and originally released for the Japanese MSX home computer system in 1987. Sega licensed the franchise in 1988 and released the game for the Master System (the Mark III in Japan), featuring enhanced graphics and entirely different overworld and dungeon layouts. This version was released worldwide under the name Golvellius: Valley of Doom.
Later that year (1988), Compile released yet another remake for the MSX2 system, titled Shin Maou Golvellius (真・魔王ゴルベリアス, lit. "True Devil Golvellius"). This game featured mostly the same graphics as the ones in the Sega Master System version, but the overworld and dungeon layouts are entirely different.
In 2009 it was announced by DotEmu/D4 Entreprise that Golvellius was to be re-released for the iPhone OS platform.The scenario is the same in all the three different versions of Golvellius. The ending promised a sequel, which was never developed/released. However, there is a spin-off game titled Super Cooks that came included in the 1989 release of the Disc Station Special Shoka Gou.
