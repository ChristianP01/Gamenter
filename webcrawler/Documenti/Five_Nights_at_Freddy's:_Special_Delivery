Descrizione: Five Nights at Freddy's: Special Delivery is a 2019 augmented reality survival horror video game developed and published by Illumix for Android and iOS. It is the third spin-off in the Five Nights at Freddy's series and the tenth game overall.  The game, which presents itself as an animatronic rental service created by the in-universe comapny Fazbear Entertainment, takes inspiration from the history of Five Nights at Freddy's across all media, and continues the storyline established in Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted, briding the gap between it and its sequel, Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach, released in 2021.
Gameplay is presented from the first-person perspective with a primary focus on the player's flashlight and controlled shocker. The player can freely move around their home, interacting with the animatronic, and unlocking new animatronics and skins by defeating them. Outside the main game, the player is able to salvage animatronics for parts, and can also send their own animatronics to their friends' homes. Combat focuses on finding static based on where the animatronic is, and giving them a controlled shock when they charge at the player.
Development of Special Delivery, the first game by Illumix, began in 2018 and took little over a year. The game was first announced in August 2018, and was first realeased in early access on November 22, 2019, with a full release three days later, on November 25. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at its combat, narrative, content, voice performance and original soundtrack.
