Titolo: Freeway (video game)

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Freeway is an action video game written by David Crane for the Atari 2600 and published by Activision in 1981.
One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to "get to the other side". Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner is the player who has scored the most points in the time allotted.
