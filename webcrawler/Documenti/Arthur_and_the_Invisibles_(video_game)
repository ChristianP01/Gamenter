Titolo: Arthur and the Invisibles (video game)

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Arthur and the Invisibles (known in Europe as Arthur and the Minimoys) is a video game based on the 2006 film of the same name by Luc Besson.
The game allows players to relive the fantastic adventure of Arthur and his two friends, Selenia and Bétamèche, in their mission to save the Minimoys' world from destruction. The game incorporates Besson's Minimoy universe and its inhabitants.
Gameplay revolves around the teamwork of the trio (Arthur, Selenia and Bétamèche): players can progress by combining the three characters' skills. These skills are expanded upon as the game progresses, ranging from detectors that allow to find the game's collectibles (Bétamèche), upgrading Selenia's dagger to The Sword of Power, and allowing Arthur to remove shields equipped by some enemies. A common puzzle throughout the game involves stacking pieces of a standing stone, called a "Flagstone", in order to open doors. Players also get the chance to stack on top of a Mogoth to cross razor-sharp stone pathways, as well as ride among monstrously huge spiders and ladybugs in order to access some areas.
The DS version of the game consists of playing a series of mini-games and raising pet mul-muls that can interact with those from other people's games.
