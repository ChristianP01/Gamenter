Titolo: Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing is a racing video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System console released in 1990. It is an adaption of the 1989 Japanese-market Famicom game World Grand Prix - Pole to Finish (ワールドグランプリ ポールトゥフィニッシュ), with the most notable changes being the addition of Unser as an in-game coach, the number of laps, sound and interface design. Therefore, the game remains based on the Formula 1 World Championship, despite Unser having never competed in it. This game features a season mode and two time trial modes. In season mode the player uses either Al Unser Jr. or make their own driver.
Versions released outside North America were simply titled Turbo Racing with all references to Unser removed, due to the relative obscurity of CART and Unser outside of North America.
