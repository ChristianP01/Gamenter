Titolo: Exerion

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Exerion is a shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Jaleco for arcades in February 1983, and licensed to Taito for manufacture and distribution of the game in North America. The player controls a starship and must fire at enemies on the screen while avoiding projectiles. The game uses a pseudo-3D scrolling background, giving a sense of depth, and the player's ship has a sense of inertia while it is being controlled with the joystick.
Exerion was ported to the MSX, Family Computer, and SG-1000. Two sequels were released.
