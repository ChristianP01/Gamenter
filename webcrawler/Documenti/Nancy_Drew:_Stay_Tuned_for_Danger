Titolo: Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Stay Tuned for Danger is the second installment in the Nancy Drew point-and-click adventure game series by Her Interactive. It was officially discontinued in 2011 before re-releasing in 2016 after the company had transferred to their new gaming system. It had an ESRB rating of E for moments of mild violence and peril. Players took on the first-person view of fictional amateur sleuth Nancy Drew and solved the mystery through interrogation of suspects, solving puzzles, and discovering clues. It featured longer game play and improved graphics compared to the previous game, Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill. It was also the first one in the series to feature three-dimensional suspects. There were three levels of gameplay: Junior, Senior, and Master detective modes. Each mode offered a different difficulty level of puzzles and hints, but none of these changes affected the actual plot of the game. It was loosely based on a book of the same name, Stay Tuned for Danger (1987).
