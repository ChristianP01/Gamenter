Titolo: Nemesis (video game)

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Nemesis (ネメシス, Nemeshisu) is a 1990 shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Konami for the Game Boy. It is part of the Gradius series. Similar to Taito's Sagaia, this game uses a once-international title for an earlier game in the series to represent a mostly original project.
A sequel, Nemesis II, was released for the same platform in 1991. Both games were later rereleased through the Konami GB Collection series, where they are titled Gradius and Gradius II instead.
