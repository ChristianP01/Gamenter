Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Puyo Puyo (ぷよぷよ) is a puzzle video game released in 1991 by Compile for the MSX2. Since its creation, it uses characters from Madou Monogatari. It was created by Masamitsu "Moo" Niitani, the founder of Compile, who was inspired by certain elements from the Tetris and Dr. Mario series of games.
The game was released by Tokuma Shoten on the same day of the MSX2 release under the name Famimaga Disk Vol. 5: Puyo Puyo (ファミマガディスク Vol.5 ぷよぷよ, Famimaga Disuku Boryūmu Faibu: Puyo Puyo) and as part of the Famimaga Disk series for the Family Computer Disk System. A year after the MSX2 and FDS versions, Sega released an arcade version, which heavily expanded the previous versions by including a one-player story mode and a two-player competitive mode.
