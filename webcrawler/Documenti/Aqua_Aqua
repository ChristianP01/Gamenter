Titolo: Aqua Aqua

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Aqua Aqua, known in Japan as Aquaqua (アクアクア, Akuakua), and in Europe as Aqua Aqua: Wetrix 2, is a puzzle video game developed by Zed Two, the studio of Ste and John Pickford, for the PlayStation 2. It was published in North America by The 3DO Company in North America, Imagineer in Japan, and SCi Games in Europe. It is the sequel to Wetrix (1998) and has very similar gameplay; the player, on a landscape, uses Uppers to create walls for enclosures that hold flying water bubbles, contending with bombs and hazards like rainstorms, bombs, and ice cubes in the process.
Imagineer commissioned a sequel to Wetrix following the predecessor's critical and commercial success. It was the third PlayStation 2 puzzle game Fantavision and Super Bust-A-Move, it was released on January 9, 2001 in North America, and sold 70,000+ copies in the West and 15,000+ in Japan. Aqua Aqua was generally well-received by professional critics for its addictiveness, graphics and sound. Criticism was targeted at the steep learning curve, the short length of the Story mode, the fixed camera and loose controls causing imprecise piece placements, and how little advantage was taken with the console's hardware.
