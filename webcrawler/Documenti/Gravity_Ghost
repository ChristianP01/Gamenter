Descrizione: Gravity Ghost is a physics based puzzle game created by indie developer Ivy Games. It was released on Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux on 26 January 2015. In Gravity Ghost, the player controls the ghost of a young girl named Iona, who flies through a fantasised version of space (analogous with purgatory) with her friend, a ghost fox. As a living girl, Iona lives on a secluded island with her three sisters, her mother and father. The eldest sister, Hickory, becomes their guardian after the sudden death of their parents. The plot is revealed gradually through a series of animated cutscenes, as Iona seeks to mend a planet which has been torn apart and replaced by a black hole.
