Titolo: Chew Man Fu

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Chew Man Fu is a 1990 action video game developed by Now Production and published in Japan by Hudson Soft and in North America by NEC for the TurboGrafx-16.
Chew Man Fu was created by Now Production, an Osaka-based game development company founded in 1986 by Toshiaki Awamura, who would later work on future projects such as Adventure Island II and Rolling Thunder 3. First released on the TurboGrafx-16, the game has since been ported for mobile phones, with new visuals and level design, and re-released through digital platforms like the Virtual Console and the Japanese cloud gaming service G-cluster, in addition of being included on the PC Engine Mini console.
Chew Man Fu garnered mostly positive reception since its release on the TurboGrafx-16; critics found the game's design to be unusual but straightforward and commended its strong action element, large and detailed character sprites, controls, technical performance and use of passwords to resume progress, but other reviewers felt mixed regarding the overall audiovisual presentation and simple gameplay, while the maze editor was criticized for lacking the ability to save levels. Retrospective commentary has been equally positive. One of the title's main characters appears in Pixel Puzzle Collection (2018) for Android and iOS devices.
