Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Live for Speed (LFS) is a racing simulator developed by a three-person team comprising Scawen Roberts, Eric Bailey, and Victor van Vlaardingen. The main focus is to provide a realistic racing experience for the online multiplayer game and to allow single player races against AI cars. Users can set personal bests which can then be uploaded to LFSWorld in hotlap mode, and take driving lessons in 'training' mode.LFS is entirely distributed via the Internet. It can be downloaded and installed for free from the official website, but unlocking all of the content (and some features) requires purchasing a license. Without a license it functions as a content-limited demo without time restrictions, with only one track and three cars available.
