Descrizione: Mega Man Battle Network 3 is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the third game in the Mega Man Battle Network series, released in 2002 in Japan and 2003 in North America. The European version featured a completely different logo, which was also used on Mega Man X7, Mega Man X8, Mega Man X: Command Mission, Mega Man Zero 2, Mega Man Zero 3, Mega Man Zero 4, Mega Man Network Transmission, Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge, Mega Man Battle Network 4, and Mega Man Battle Network 5. While in North America and Europe, two complementary versions of the game - Blue and White - exist, marketed simultaneously, this was not the case in Japan. The game was first released in a single version in this region, although later a Black version containing bug fixes, new areas, optional bosses, and other improvements was released some months after the original. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on December 17, 2014 and in North America on May 14, 2015.
