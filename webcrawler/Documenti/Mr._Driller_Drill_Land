Descrizione: Mr. Driller Drill Land is a 2002 puzzle video game developed and published in Japan by Namco for the GameCube. It is the fifth entry in the Mr. Driller video game series, and the second developed for a Nintendo platform following Mr. Driller A. Controlling one of seven characters, the player must make it to the bottom of each stage by destroying colored blocks, which can connect to each other and form chain reactions. The game is divided into five different modes themed as amusement park attractions, which feature new mechanics such as enemies, items and different block types.
Development of the game was by Project Driller, the internal development group behind the series. The soundtrack was composed by Go Shiina and was the last Mr. Driller title he worked on. A prototype game featuring four-person multiplayer was shown off at a Nintendo press conference, titled Shin Mr. Driller, and intended for a fall 2002 release in Japan. It was later delayed to winter of that year after being shown at the 2002 Tokyo Game Show, where it was given its final title of Drill Land. The game features support for the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable, allowing the player to import their "Pacteria" pets from Mr. Driller A into the game.
Mr. Driller Drill Land was met with a positive response from critics, who applauded the game's overall presentation, amount of content, multiplayer and graphics, some calling it one of the best Mr. Driller games and one of the best puzzle games for the GameCube. It was followed by Mr. Driller Drill Spirits for the Nintendo DS in 2004. A high-definition remaster for the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows was released internationally on June 25, 2020. Versions for the Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 were released on November 4, 2021.
