Descrizione: Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, known in Japan as Naruto Shippuden: Narutimate Storm 2 (NARUTO (ナルト) 疾風伝 ナルティメットストーム2) is a fighting game developed by CyberConnect2. It is the second installment in the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, and the sequel to Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm published by Namco Bandai Games. It is based on the anime and manga series Naruto by Masashi Kishimoto, and was released in mid-2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. As a sequel to Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, the story and cast are based on their Part II manga appearances, known in the anime as Naruto Shippuden. The game mainly stars title character Naruto Uzumaki, a teenage ninja, and his fights against the Akatsuki terrorist organization.
The game began development following the completion of Ultimate Ninja Storm, and took into account fans' comments about the first game. The team wanted to include more drama in this game to appeal to more gamers. As well as Naruto characters, the game features Tekken character Lars Alexandersson as a guest character. His inclusion was the result of CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama seeing his alternate design by Kishimoto for Tekken 6. The audio was composed by Chikayo Fukuda.
Critical response to the game has ranged from average to positive. Reviewers praised the visuals and boss fights comparing them positively to the anime series, but criticized the lack of events in the world map after completing the game's story mode. Storm 2 has achieved strong sales, becoming one of Bandai's bestselling games for 2010. A sequel, called Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, was released in 2013. All the Storm games were re-released in 2017 as part of a compilation.
