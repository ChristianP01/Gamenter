Titolo: Sporting Triangles

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Sporting Triangles was a quiz programme, devised by Matthew Davies and Robert Lawrence, which tested sports personalities' knowledge of sport. The programme was produced by Central Television and aired on the ITV network for four series from 7 January 1987 until 13 August 1990. The original host was Nick Owen, who hosted series 1 and 2; he was replaced by Andy Craig for the final two series (3 and 4).
Captains included Jimmy Greaves and Emlyn Hughes, who had just finished his role as a captain on the BBC equivalent, A Question of Sport. Despite Hughes' presence, Sporting Triangles struggled to match its better-known rival.
