Titolo: Escape from Monkey Island

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Escape from Monkey Island is an adventure game developed and released by LucasArts in 2000. It is the fourth game in the Monkey Island series and the first to use 3D graphics.
The game centers on the pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who returns home with his wife Elaine Marley after their honeymoon, to find her erroneously declared dead, and her office of governor up for election. Guybrush must find a way to restore Elaine to office, while uncovering a plot to turn the Caribbean into a tourist trap, headed by his nemesis LeChuck and an Australian conspirator Ozzie Mandrill. Escape from Monkey Island was the second game to use the GrimE engine, which was upgraded from its first use in Grim Fandango.
Escape from Monkey Island won positive reviews and was a moderate commercial success. It was ultimately the last LucasArts adventure game to be released, as the company's later projects Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels and Sam & Max: Freelance Police were canceled in 2003 and 2004, respectively. A follow-up to Escape, entitled Tales of Monkey Island, was released by Telltale Games in 2009.
