Titolo: Kowloon High-School Chronicle

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Kowloon High-School Chronicle is a dungeon crawler role-playing video game and visual novel hybrid developed by Shout! Design Works and published by Atlus for the PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2004. In 2020, it received a remaster for the Nintendo Switch, which was localized into English the following year.
Modeled after films such as Indiana Jones and The Mummy, the game revolves around exploring an Ancient Egyptian ruin in search of treasure. The Egyptian aspects are contrasted with Japanese elements, such as myths from the Nihon Shoki. The protagonist also attends modern-day Japanese high school, gradually building relationships with his fellow classmates. Being a role-playing game with social elements, and revolving around high school students fighting folkloric monsters, the game has been compared to modern entries in the Persona series – although Kowloon precedes said entries.Series director Shuuhou Imai has a long history of making games in the category he calls gakuen juvenile denki (學園ジュヴナイル伝奇, lit. "young adult school fantasy"), starting with the Tokyo Majin Gakuen Denki series. Though Kowloon is inextricably linked to the series and even takes place in the same fictional universe, it is only the second related video game to be released in English, after Tokyo Twilight Ghost Hunters. Kowloon, along with other games under the gakuen juvenile denki moniker, is considered a cult classic in Japan, but has garnered comparatively little attention in the West.
