Descrizione: Def Jam Vendetta is a 2003 professional wrestling video game that combines hip hop with pro wrestling.  It was released for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube under the EA Sports BIG label in North America and Europe, and the EA Games label in Japan. It was EA's first attempt at a wrestling game since the widely panned WCW Backstage Assault. Several hip hop artists were featured in the game, including DMX, Method Man, Redman, Ludacris, N.O.R.E.,  Capone, Scarface, Ghostface Killah, Keith Murray, WC, Joe Budden and DJ Funkmaster Flex; all of which at the time were artists of Def Jam. Singer Christina Milian was also featured in the game as "Angel". A sequel, Def Jam: Fight for NY, was released on September 20, 2004 to largely positive reviews.
