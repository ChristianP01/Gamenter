Descrizione: Rapid Racer, known as Turbo Prop Racing in North America, is a racing video game developed by SCE Studios Soho and published by Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively for the PlayStation. In the game, the player takes control of a motorboat and races around six different tracks. Eventually, all six tracks can be raced mirrored, as well as set at night time.
By winning championships and completing bonus rounds (unlocked by five yellow icons during a race but first two-day tracks), players can unlock them which they can use to either upgrade their boat or unlock a higher-powered one.
