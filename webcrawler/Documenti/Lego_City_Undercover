Titolo: Lego City Undercover

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Lego City Undercover is an action-adventure platform video game developed by TT Fusion, originally released for the Wii U by Nintendo in 2013. It was later re-released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows via Steam by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in 2017. Based on the City themed toyline by Lego, the narrative follows cop Chase McCain as he returns to Lego City and pursues escaped crime boss Rex Fury. Gameplay features McCain both exploring the open world hub of Lego City, and completing self-contained levels featuring puzzles and combat. The original version was single-player only, while the re-release added local two-player multiplayer.
The first prototypes for Lego City Undercover were produced in 2010, with development beginning in 2011 after Nintendo approached parent company TT Games about developing for the Wii U. At the time production began, it was to be the first title featuring voice acting, and it was the first in the TT Games Lego series not to rely on a movie or comic license. The script, written by Graham Goring, made extensive use of parody and reference to both crime shows, and other movies and television series. The Lego City hub was based on multiple real locations.
The game was originally announced in 2011 as Lego City Stories for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS. The 3DS version was a standalone prequel, Lego City Undercover: The Chase Begins. The game saw positive reviews for its story, humor, and evolved gameplay formula. Criticism focused on the lack of co-op options and long loading times. The original Wii U version had sold over one million copies worldwide as of 2019.
