Titolo: Loki's Minions Capture the Flag

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Loki's Minions Capture the Flag (LMCTF) was one of the first Quake II mods and the first ever capture the flag mod released for the game. It was created by Mike "Jormungard" Scandizzo of Clan Loki's Minions.  The mod was released the day after the Quake II source code was released and soon became very popular.  Its defining feature was the use of an off-hand grappling hook, which allowed the player to fly through the air while still being able to fire their weapon.
