Titolo: Battlemorph

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Battlemorph is a shooter video game developed by Attention to Detail and published by Atari Corporation exclusively for the Atari Jaguar CD in North America and Europe on December 1995. It is the sequel to Cybermorph, a pack-in game for the Atari Jaguar that was originally released on November 23, 1993.
Set 30 years after the events in Cybermorph, the player takes control of a morphing infiltration fighter craft named War Griffon in an extermination mission against the returning Pernitia Empire, who plans to take over the galaxy and eradicate humanity after being pushed back into their home planet by creating invasion fleets in order to do so, and liberate multiple galaxy clusters from their control. Originally announced in early 1994 as one of the first upcoming titles for the Jaguar CD, Battlemorph was conceived and pitched to Atari Corp. after the release of Cybermorph, with the team using content ideas that were not included in the original game and became the last project developed by ATD for the Jaguar, before Atari discontinued both platforms and merged with JT Storage in April 1996.
Battlemorph received mostly positive reviews when it was released, with critics praising the graphics, soundtrack, the ability to traverse across any terrain and overall improvements made over Cybermorph, while some felt divided in regards to the controls and was criticized for its short draw distance. Online publications such as AllGame have referred it as one of the best games released for the Atari Jaguar CD add-on.
