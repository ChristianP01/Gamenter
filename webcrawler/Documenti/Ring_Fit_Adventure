Descrizione: Ring Fit Adventure is an exercising action role-playing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The game comes with two physical components: the Ring-Con, a Pilates ring that the user holds and one Joy-Con slots into, and a Leg Strap, a piece of fabric affixed to the user's leg that holds the other Joy-Con.
The game's main mode has the player complete a turn-based role-playing game, where player movements and battle actions are based on performing certain physical activities using the Ring-Con and Leg Strap, with the motion controls within the Joy-Con sensing the player's movement, and a strain sensor in the Ring-Con detecting bending of that accessory. Other modes include general guided fitness routines and party-style games. These activities are centered around common fitness exercises, making the game part of Nintendo's "quality of life" goals in line with a similar game of theirs, Wii Fit. The game was released worldwide on October 18, 2019 and received generally positive reviews from critics. As of June 2021, the game has sold over 11 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling games on the system.
Demand for the game increased drastically during 2020, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related closures of gyms and other exercise facilities, causing shortages in many countries. This led to resellers in America selling the game for over $300, up from its retail price of $80.
