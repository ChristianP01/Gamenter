Titolo: Noah's Ark (video game)

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Noah's Ark is a platform game for the Nintendo Entertainment System produced by British studio Source R&D and published in 1992 by Konami. It was only released in Europe. Unlike most other games based on Biblical content released around the same time, this one was officially approved by Nintendo. It is very loosely based on the biblical story with the same name. It was planned on to be published by Matchbox in the US, but it was cancelled due to Nintendo of America having a ban on religious references.
