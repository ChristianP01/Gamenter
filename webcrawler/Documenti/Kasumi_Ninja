Titolo: Kasumi Ninja

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Kasumi Ninja is a fighting game, developed by Hand Made Software and published by Atari Corporation. Initially it was exclusively for the Atari Jaguar in North America and Europe on December 21, 1994, and was later released in Japan by Messe Sansao on July 1995. It was the first fighting title to be released for the Jaguar, and unsuccessfully sought to capitalize on the trend of ultra violent fighting games started by Midway's Mortal Kombat in 1992.When the elder ninja Gyaku kills two of his fellow elders through black magic and becomes possessed by a powerful demon after breaking the gate to the underworld, it is up to the player in taking the role from any of the playable characters in order to defeat other opponents before Lord Gyaku destroys the Earth. Being one of the first titles announced for the Jaguar before it was launched to the public in November 1993, Kasumi Ninja was created by the same company who previously developed Dracula the Undead for the Atari Lynx in 1991 and had a troubled development process, undergoing through various changes before release. It was also one of the first games to feature a parental lockout system, allowing censorship and limiting the violence displayed during gameplay.Kasumi Ninja received mixed to negative reception when it was released. While it received praise for its visuals, critics panned the controls, sound and slow gameplay, with many reviewers calling it a Mortal Kombat rip-off. By April 1, 1995, the game has sold more than 24,000 copies though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime and has since been called by some as one of the worst games of all time. A sequel, Kasumi Ninja II, was in development for the Atari Jaguar CD but it was cancelled.
