Titolo: Lifeline (video game)

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Lifeline, released in Japan as Operator's Side (オペレーターズサイド, Operētāzu Saido), is a video game released by SCEI and Konami for the PlayStation 2.
Its defining aspect is that the player controls the game entirely by using a microphone to speak commands to on-screen characters. These commands are interpreted by the game via speech recognition. It is generally regarded by game reviewers as average, although its innovation has caused it to become a cult classic among fans.
The game sold well enough to become one of the PS2 The Best, with the lower-priced version released on September 25, 2003, in Japan. Both versions in Japan included the option to purchase the USB headset packaged with the game. The North American release did not offer this bundle.
