Titolo: Armored Core: Nexus

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Armored Core: Nexus is a 2004 third-person shooter mecha video game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 2. It is the eighth entry in the Armored Core series and a direct sequel to 2003's Silent Line: Armored Core. Unlike Silent Line, Nexus is not an expansion but rather a full-fledged sequel.
The game's plot concerns a new corporation called Navis that begins to hoard ancient technology, leading to tensions between it and the existing corporations. As those tensions begin to mount, the player takes on missions through the reorganized Raven's Ark until the corporations break into all out war. When the corporations begin to activate ancient weapons in desperation, the player takes on more critical tasks of attempting to stop the weapons before they destroy everything on the planet.
Very little has changed from Armored Core's primary gameplay mechanics in Nexus. Players pilot mechs, take on missions, and earn money that they can use to customize their mech units. New additions to the game include dual analog stick support and a LAN multiplayer mode.
