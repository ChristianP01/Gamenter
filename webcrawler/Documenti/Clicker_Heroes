Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Clicker Heroes is an idle game that was developed by American independent studio Playsaurus. It was originally released for browsers in 2014, for mobile devices in 2015, and for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles in 2017. The game is a spinoff of Playsaurus's earlier game Cloudstone, from which it uses many graphic elements.Clicker Heroes is free-to-play, but players can use  microtransactions to buy an in-game currency called "rubies". This currency is not required to progress through the game; it was added some time into the game's life and multiple gameplay mechanics center around obtaining the premium currency in-game.
Clicker Heroes received positive reception from critics; Nathan Grayson of Kotaku called it "[a] perfect office space distraction".
