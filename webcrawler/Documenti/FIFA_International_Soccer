Descrizione: FIFA International Soccer is a 1993 association football video game developed by EA Canada's Extended Play Productions team and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console in December 1993 and ported to numerous other systems in 1994. It is the first game in the FIFA series.
The original Mega Drive version was commercially successful in Europe, becoming the best-selling home video game of 1993 in the United Kingdom. The game was also positively received by critics upon release; critics lauded the detail and animation of the footballers in the game, the crowd sound effects, and the overall presentation. The speed the game ran at and issues with the response to the player's input were seen as the game's primary faults. The 3DO version was an enhanced edition with multiple camera views and more detailed graphics than other versions, and was a high-profile showcase for the 3DO's power. The game sold well, with the Mega Drive version becoming the best-selling home video game of 1993 in the United Kingdom. It later served as a pack-in game for the Goldstar 3DO, and led to a sequel, FIFA Soccer 95.
