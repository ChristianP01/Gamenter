Megatech expanded upon the game's concept during localization, introducing upgrade items, a different plot and English voicework.
Metal & Lace garnered mixed reception from critics since its release, most of which reviewed it as an import title; critics felt that its use of erotism was disappointing and criticized its high difficulty, while most reviewers were divided in regards to the audiovisual presentation, controls and gameplay. It was later followed by a Japan-exclusive sequel titled Ningyou Tsukai 2, which was first released for PC-98 (1996) and later for Microsoft Windows (1997).
