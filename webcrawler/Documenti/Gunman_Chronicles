Titolo: Gunman Chronicles

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Gunman Chronicles or Half-Life: Gunman (previously Gunman: TC and simply Gunman) is a first-person shooter space Western video game originally created as a mod by the now defunct Rewolf Software. Gunman Chronicles was originally a Quake deathmatch mod named Gunmanship 101, then it was moved to Quake II's engine before becoming a Half-Life mod. The game was popular at the Half-Life Mod Expo in 1999, and Sierra approached Rewolf to make a retail version. After significant work and with some office space, funding, and added staff, it was released as a standalone game. Plans were drawn to release Gunman Chronicles on GameCube, but it was never released.
