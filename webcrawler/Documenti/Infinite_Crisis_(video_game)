In the most popular game mode, players controlled their champions, destroying enemy turrets and completing the set objectives. In order to win, each team's goal was to destroy the opposing team's power core, a building inside the enemy base.  This goal was achieved by destroying enemy drones and turrets.As of August 14, 2015, Infinite Crisis and its servers were shut down.
