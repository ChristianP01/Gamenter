Descrizione: Puyo Puyo Tetris (ぷよぷよテトリス, Puyopuyo Tetorisu) is a puzzle video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. The game is a crossover between the Puyo Puyo series and the Tetris franchise, and features various gameplay modes incorporating both aspects. The game includes characters modeled and named after the seven Tetrominos, which are different puzzle pieces each made of four blocks.
Puyo Puyo Tetris was the first Tetris-related title published by Sega since the PlayStation 2 game Sega Ages 2500: Tetris Collection, an installment in the Sega Ages series, in 2006. Puyo Puyo Tetris adopts the guidelines used in contemporary Tetris games, so the rotation patterns and colors of the Tetrominoes differ from Sega's previous releases.

The PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch versions were released outside of Japan in April 2017, marking the first English localization of a Puyo Puyo game since Puyo Pop Fever in 2004. A Microsoft Windows version was released in February 2018.In August 2020, a sequel titled Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 was announced. It was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in December 2020 and for Microsoft Windows in March 2021.
