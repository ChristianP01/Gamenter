Titolo: Track & Field II

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Track & Field II, known in Japan as Konami Sports in Seoul, is a sequel to Track & Field created by Konami for the NES in 1988. It still continues the Olympic-themed sports events, but adds more realism by choosing a country for the player to represent. The series boasted 15 sporting events, with two of them available as bonus stages between rounds of the "Olympic" mode. As the Japanese title indicates, the game is based on the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, hence the introduction of Taekwondo (a Korean martial art) as one of the events.
A common problem players had with the game was that many of the events required a power meter to be built up by rapidly pressing the A button, then releasing it with the B button. Many players could not press the A button fast enough to build up enough power, though it could be done with a turbo controller, or using a method similar to strumming a guitar, by holding the controller against the player's chest or a flat surface and using the thumb and index finger together, running them rapidly across the A button.
