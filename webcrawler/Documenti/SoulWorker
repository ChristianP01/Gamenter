Descrizione: SoulWorker (Hangul: 소울워커, also known as SoulWorker Online) is an anime-style free action massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMOARPG) developed by Lion Games Studios from South Korea. The game story takes place fifteen years ago after a portal, known as the void, started bringing demons into the world. Fifteen years later, children that were once lost to the void were transported back to their world. Armed with supernatural powers, these children were to be known as SoulWorkers.
