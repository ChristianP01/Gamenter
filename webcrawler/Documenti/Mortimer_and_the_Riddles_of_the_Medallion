Titolo: Mortimer and the Riddles of the Medallion

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Mortimer and the Riddles of the Medallion is a 1996 children's first-person puzzle video game developed and published by LucasArts. Released for Windows and Macintosh, the game follows an oversized, anthropomorphic snail named Mortimer, who seeks to save a fantasy world's animal population. Players pilot Mortimer—whose shell can transform into an aircraft or submarine— through a 3D world, while solving riddles and learning simple biology. The game was announced at the May 1995 Electronic Entertainment Expo, as an attempt by LucasArts to reach a younger demographic. The game uses the Star Wars: Rebel Assault engine. The game was also displayed at E3 1996; at the show, a writer for Computer Games Strategy Plus remarked that it was "very hard to sneer at the pure and lustrous quality of this kiddie title."
