Titolo: Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version are 2004 remakes of the 1996 Game Boy role-playing video games Pokémon Red and Blue. They were developed by Game Freak, published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. FireRed and LeafGreen were first released in Japan in January 2004 and in North America and Europe in September and October 2004 respectively. The games are part of the third generation of the Pokémon video game series and hold the distinction of being the first enhanced remakes of previous games within the franchise.
As in previous games, the player controls the player character from an overhead perspective and participates in turn-based battles. Throughout the games, the player captures and raises Pokémon for use in battle. New features include a contextual help menu and a new region the player may access after a certain point in the story. The games have compatibility with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which originally came bundled with the games.
The games received mostly positive reviews, obtaining an aggregate score of 81 percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised the fact that the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and lacked improvement compared to the previous games, Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. FireRed and LeafGreen were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12 million copies worldwide. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player's Choice titles.
