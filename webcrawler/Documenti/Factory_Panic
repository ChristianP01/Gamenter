Descrizione: Factory Panic, originally titled Ganbare Gorubī (Japanese: がんばれゴルビー!), is an action game developed by JSH Co. for the Game Gear handheld game console, and published by Sega in 1991. In Brazil, Tec Toy retitled the game to Crazy Company.
In Ganbare Gorubī, the original Japanese version of the game, the player character ("Gorby") is patterned after Mikhail Gorbachev, who was President of the Soviet Union at the time of the game's development and release. As Gorby, the player must use a system of conveyor belts to send goods to people queueing outside a factory.
In Factory Panic, the European version of the game, the player character is instead a blond-haired boy. A corrupt business magnate called Mister Greede has been withholding food and other necessities from the people of Segaville. The player infiltrates Mr. Greede's factory to distribute goods to the waiting citizens.Sega released Ganbare Gorubī in Japan two months after Tokuma Shoten released their Gorbachev-inspired game, Gorby's Pipeline Plan (ゴルビーのパイプライン大作戦, Gorubī no Paipurain Daisakusen), for the Famicom video game console. Both games were released in Japan several months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
