Titolo: Crossfire (1981 video game)

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Crossfire is a multidirectional shooter created by Jay Sullivan for the Apple II and published by On-Line Systems in 1981. It was ported to the Atari 8-bit family, VIC-20, Commodore 64, and IBM PC (as a self-booting disk). The Atari 8-bits had a separate cartridge and magnetic media release; the cartridge version ran on a 16k machine and used character mode graphics while the magnetic media version largely duplicated the graphics from the Apple II and ran in hi-res bitmap mode, needing 32k of memory to run. The C64 release had background music which is absent from other versions. A cartridge version of Crossfire was a 1984 launch title for the IBM PCjr, announced in late 1983.
