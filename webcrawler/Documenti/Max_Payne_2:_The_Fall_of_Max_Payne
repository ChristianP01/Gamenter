Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a third-person shooter video game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Rockstar Games in October 2003. It is the sequel to Max Payne (2001) and the second game in the Max Payne series. Max Payne 2 continues the story of the titular character, a detective for the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and former vigilante, as he is reunited with contract killer Mona Sax and must work with her to resolve a conspiracy full of death and betrayal.
Max Payne 2 received highly positive reviews from critics and, like its predecessor, cited by some as one of the greatest video games ever made. Praise focused on its action and story, while criticism targeted its short length. Despite the positive reception, the game sold poorly, leading Rockstar Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive to cite Max Payne 2's sales as a cause for the company's reforecast finances of 2004. Max Payne 2 received several industry awards, including Outstanding Art Direction at the Golden Satellite Awards 2004, and Editors' Choice Awards from GamePro, IGN, and GameSpy. A sequel, Max Payne 3, was released in 2012.
On November 15, 2021, Microsoft announced that in celebration of 20 years of Xbox, they would be adding over 70 more games to their backwards compatibility program. Included in these games was the entirety of the Max Payne series, which are now available to be purchased and played on Microsoft's Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S Consoles.
