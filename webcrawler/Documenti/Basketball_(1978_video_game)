Titolo: Basketball (1978 video game)

Anno: 1978

Descrizione: Basketball is an Atari 2600 video game written by Alan Miller and published by Atari, Inc. in 1978. The cartridge presents a simple game of one-on-one basketball playable by one or two players, one of the few early Atari 2600 titles to have a single-player mode with an AI-controlled opponent. Miller wrote a version of Basketball for the Atari 8-bit family with improved graphics, published in 1979. That same year an arcade version similar to the computer port was released by Atari but in black and white.
