Titolo: Chaos Field

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Chaos Field is a 2004 vertical-scrolling shooter arcade game developed by MileStone Inc.. The game consists entirely of boss battles, featuring five stages with three bosses each. The player can choose to play as one of three characters, each with their own ship that has a unique primary weapon. The player can flip the environment at will between two parallel worlds.
Chaos Field is the first game from MileStone, a company founded by former Compile employees looking to develop high quality shooters similar to those Compile was known for in the past. The game experienced a troubled development cycle due to a lack of organization and the number of employees involved. After its release in Japanese arcades, it was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in Japan. The GameCube version was also released in North America, and included a mode that adds small waves of enemies between the bosses. Critics found the game to be overwhelmingly average, a generic shooter lacking in polish and execution.
