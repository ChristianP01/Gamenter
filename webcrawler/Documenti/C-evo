Titolo: C-evo

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: C-evo is a free turn-based strategy computer game whose source code is in the public domain by German developer Steffen Gerlach, its programmer and designer, making the game freeware. 
C-evo is an empire building game based on Civilization II, but with a different focus; it aims to be a pure "game" with all players playing to win, rather than the more simulationist side of the Civilization series.  As a result, it is known for tough and uncompromising artificial intelligence computer opponents; some of these AIs have been contributed by the player base and are separately downloadable.
