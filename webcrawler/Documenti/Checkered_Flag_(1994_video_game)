Titolo: Checkered Flag (1994 video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Checkered Flag is a formula one racing video game developed by Rebellion Developments and published by Atari Corporation for the Atari Jaguar on November 28, 1994 and later released in Japan by Messe Sansao on July 1995. It is a remake of Atari's 1991 Atari Lynx title of the same name.
Taking a more simulation-based approach compared to the original game, players compete against other racers across multiple tracks in order to finish on first place and advance to the next course. Originally advertised as a direct sequel to the Atari Lynx original, Checkered Flag went through multiple changes before settling down under its final name and it is inspired by Sega's 1992 arcade game Virtua Racing.
Checkered Flag received very mixed reception since its release. By April 1, 1995, the game has sold more than 20,000 copies though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime.
