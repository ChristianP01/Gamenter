Descrizione: Bari Bari Densetsu (バリバリ伝説, Baribari Densetsu, lit. "Vroom Vroom Legend") is an early motorbike racing manga series by Shuichi Shigeno. It was published in 38 volumes between 1983 and 1991 by Kodansha. In 1985, it won the Kodansha Manga Award for shōnen.Earlier parts of the story focus both on high school life as well as street racing. At first the characters are illegal street racers (Japanese: hashiriya) that race on public roads, particularly on the winding mountain roads known as tōge. Those kind of racers were called "rolling-zoku", a type of bōsōzoku, and were seen as a social problem in Japan. Later parts of the story revolve around professional motorcycle racing events held on road circuits like the All Japan Road Race Championship.
Two OVA episodes based on the manga were produced in 1986 by Pierrot, "Part I: Tsukuba Arc" and "Part II: Suzuka Arc." The episodes were later re-edited and released in theaters in August 1987 by Nippon Herald (now part of Kadokawa Pictures)
