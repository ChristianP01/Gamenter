Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Highlander: The Last of the MacLeods is an action-adventure video game developed by Lore Design Limited and published by Atari Corporation exclusively for the Atari Jaguar CD first in North America on 30 October 1995 and later in Europe on November of the same year. The first installment in a planned trilogy based upon Gaumont Multimedia and Bohbot Entertainment's Highlander: The Animated Series, which was both a loose spin-off and sequel of the 1986 film of the same name, players assume the role of Quentin MacLeod in an effort to save the Dundee clan from slavers of the evil immortal Kortan. Its gameplay mainly consists of action and exploration with a main eight-button configuration.
In 1993, Atari Corp. licensed the animated television series after coming with the idea of creating a game project in Gregory Widen's Highlander franchise, as members within the company were fans of the films and Alien vs Predator producer James Hampton led its development alongside Lore Design, who previously worked on several titles for the Atari Lynx such as Kung Food. Originally intended to be a fighting game, the project was instead retooled into an adventure trilogy spanning three discs due to its scope, which were going to be released as separate entries that would have connected each of their plots into one overarching narrative, with Highlander: The Last of the MacLeods being the first title launched from the planned trilogy.
Highlander: The Last of the MacLeods received mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release on the Jaguar CD, who praised various aspects such as the presentation and graphics but others felt divided in regards to the sound design and controls, while some also drew comparison with Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil due to its similar play style. A PC port was in development by Lore Design and announced to be published under the Atari Interactive brand but it was never officially released, thus ultimately remaining as an exclusive for the add-on instead, while neither sequel in the planned trilogy were ever released to the public.
