Titolo: New Rally-X

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: New Rally-X is a maze and driving arcade game that was released by Namco in 1981. It runs on similar hardware to that of its predecessor Rally-X, and as its name suggests, it is a revised version of that title, which was released in the previous year. The only differences are that it has slightly enhanced graphics, easier gameplay, a new soundtrack, and a "Lucky Flag" that gives the player extra points for remaining fuel when collected, after which the round will continue if there are still flags remaining. The mazes are mostly identical, with some of the blocks from Rally-X changed into roads to reduce dead ends, and some different flag and rock locations. This title was manufactured in greater numbers and was much more popular in Japan than its predecessor.
While the original Rally-X (which was released under a Midway Games license) was a moderate hit in the United States, Midway only distributed this updated version in North America as an upgrade kit for Rally-X cabinets. The game appeared quite frequently in mainland Europe and the United Kingdom, mainly in the form of uncredited bootlegs. It was at least as popular as its predecessor in these parts of the world, if not even more so, primarily due to the title's greater playability and abundance of bootleg board stock.
