Titolo: Space Panic

Anno: 1980

Descrizione: Space Panic (スぺース・パ二ック, Supesu Panikku) is a 1980 arcade game designed by Universal. Predating Nintendo's Donkey Kong, and lacking a jump mechanic, Space Panic was the first game involving climbing ladders between walkable platforms. The genre was initially labeled as "climbing games," but later became known as platform games. A ColecoVision port by CBS Electronics was released in the winter holiday season of 1982.The original arcade game was commercially successful in Japan but unsuccessful in North America. Space Panic inspired a number of clones, most notably Apple Panic which became a top-seller for home computers. Lode Runner (1983) later put its own spin on climbing and digging, a lineage which eventually took on the name puzzle-platform games.
