Titolo: Neon Genesis Evangelion (video game)

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Neon Genesis Evangelion, also referred to as Neon Genesis Evangelion 64, is a 1999 fighting video game released for the Nintendo 64 in Japan by Bandai. It is based on the Gainax anime series of the same name and its 1997 film that serves as its conclusion, The End of Evangelion. Players control a mech named Evangelion Unit 01 to destroy a race of aliens known as the Angels before they eradicate the rest of the human race. The game is known for its alterations to the source material in order to make its dystopian and unsettling atmosphere suitable for an action game, and features unique endings and plotlines not present in other Evangelion media.
Evangelion 64 was developed by BEC, a company formed as a joint venture between Bandai and Human Entertainment, and supervised by Gainax. The game received mixed reviews, though it was a moderate commercial success. Reviewers were primarily critical of its lack of player involvement and reliance on button-tapping sequences. Several have identified its graphics and cutscenes as being of higher quality than other games on the Nintendo 64, with some saying it was one of the system's best from a technical standpoint. A PlayStation 2 sequel was released three years later.
