Titolo: LMA Manager

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: LMA Manager is a football management video game series developed and published by Codemasters. Developed primarily for consoles, the franchise differs from the PC-based Football Manager and Championship Manager series by focusing on visual details such as a fully 3D match engine, although still maintaining the realism and level of detail craved by fans of the genre - a unique combination when the series was first released.
The series has different titles in different regions: LMA Manager in the UK (named after the League Managers Association), BDFL Manager in Germany (basically the German equivalent of the LMA), Manager de Liga in Spain, Football Manager Campionato in Italy, and FC Manager - La Passion du Foot in France since the 2006 edition (the French edition of the series was previously named Roger Lemerre - La SÃ©lection des Champions after the former coach of the French national team).
