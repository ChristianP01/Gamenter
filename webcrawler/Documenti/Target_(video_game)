Titolo: Target (video game)

Anno: 1977

Descrizione: Target, or TARG, was an action video game written by Steve Dompier for the VDM-1 video card for S-100 bus microcomputers. It is among the earliest computer video games, released some time in 1976 or 1977.The game used the VDM-1's graphics characters in a game that Dompier described as a "shoot the airplanes sort of game". The player had a gun that could be rotated left and right, firing at targets moving sideways across the top of the screen.Target is almost certainly the first microcomputer game to be shown on national television. It appeared in late 1976 on The Tomorrow Show, mesmerizing the host Tom Snyder to the point where he had to be forced to stop playing it in order to finish the episode.
