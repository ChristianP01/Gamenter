Titolo: Over Horizon

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Over Horizon is a 1991 horizontally scrolling shooter co-developed by Pixel and Hot B, published in Japan by Hot B and in Germany by Takara for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Controlling a space fighter craft, the player must destroy numerous enemies to defeat an alien threat intending to dominate the universe.
Over Horizon was conceived as a "create your own shoot 'em up" game during a proposal with Pixel to re-use their engine from Dungeon Kid before being reworked into a standard shooter and Hot B took over development of the project, with Steel Empire co-director Yoshinori Satake at the helm overseeing the process. The title received positive reception from reviewers; criticism was geared towards its short length and low difficulty, with some regarding it as a clone of Gradius and R-Type but praise was given to the atmospheric and colorful visual presentation, use of environmental stage gimmicks, ability to customize the ship, sound design and gameplay.
