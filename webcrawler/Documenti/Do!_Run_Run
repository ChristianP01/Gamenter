Titolo: Do! Run Run

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Do! Run Run, also known as Super Pierrot (スーパーピエロ Sūpā Piero), is the fourth and final incarnation of Mr. Do!, the Universal video game mascot. Returning to his Mr. Do! roots, the clown has a bouncing powerball with which to hurl at monsters. Mr. Do runs along the playfield picking up dots and leaving a line behind him, which the player is encouraged to create closed off sections with. Precariously balanced log traps can be rolled downslope, crushing enemies. The resulting game is somewhat of a cross between Mr. Do!, Congo Bongo, Pac-Man, and Qix.
