Titolo: Amnesia Fortnight 2012

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Amnesia Fortnight 2012 is a bundle of prototypes made during a two-week public prototyping session in 2012 by Double Fine Productions, which was held in conjunction with the Humble Bundle group in 2012.  Everyone that paid a minimum of $1 had the opportunity to vote on 23 concept ideas. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top five voted ideas into game prototypes that became available to those that purchased the bundle after they were completed.  There were also three bonus prototypes included, including two from the first Amnesia Fortnight that were made into commercial games, and one prototype from the previous year's Amnesia Fortnight that hadn't been released to the public before that point.  2 Player Productions filmed a documentary about the making of the prototypes, which was included with purchase of the bundle.  Amnesia Fortnight 2012 was later released on physical media as part of a special edition bundle.
