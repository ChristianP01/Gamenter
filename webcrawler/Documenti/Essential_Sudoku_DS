Titolo: Essential Sudoku DS

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Essential Sudoku DS is a puzzle video game developed by Essential Games and published by D3 for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. It contains two types of puzzle: "picture", which are nonograms, and "number", which are sudoku puzzles.
Kim Wild of Nintendo Life gave the game a 9 out of 10 and called it "an essential purchase", because (despite a little bit clumsy interface) the puzzle variety is huge (over 1000 in total).
