Titolo: Star Fire

Anno: 1978

Descrizione: Star Fire is a first-person space combat game released in arcades by Exidy in December 1978. It was distributed in Japan by Taito and Esco Trading in 1979. Designed by David Rolfe, the look and feel of Star Fire is directly lifted from the movie Star Wars, though the game is not officially licensed.
Star Fire is the first arcade video game to use a sit-down cockpit cabinet, and the first to allow a player to enter their initials on the high score table. Though not the first game in full color without the use of monitor overlays, it was unusual in 1978.
