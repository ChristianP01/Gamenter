Titolo: Massive Assault

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Massive Assault is a turn-based, computer wargame by Wargaming.  Despite featuring 3D graphics, the game is similar to tabletop wargames in that its gameplay is governed by simple rules and takes place on a hexagonal grid. The game's opposing forces are made up of largely equivalent units. Gameplay is made somewhat more complex by the addition of "secret allies," the disclosure of which can change the course of a game.
