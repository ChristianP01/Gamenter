Titolo: Hex (video game)

Anno: 1985

Descrizione: Hex is a turn-based strategy game developed by Mark of the Unicorn and published in 1985 for the then-new Atari ST and later for the Amiga. The player controls a unicorn that is trying to turn all the hexes on the game board to the same colour. Opponents attempt to turn them to a different colour and thus defeat the unicorn. As the unicorn levels up, new spells are added to its repertoire, but only 5 can be used at any given time.
