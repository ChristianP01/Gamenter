Titolo: Forge (video game)

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Forge was a third-person massively multiplayer online combat game developed and released by Dark Vale Games on December 4, 2012. The game received mixed reviews that praised its uniqueness in its gameplay, and criticized a lack of imagination in its visual presentation. It was developed as a way to play end-game MMORPG player versus player combat, without the hours of work to get there.
The game has now been removed from Steam. Those who purchased it when it was available will have it remain in their Steam library, but because the online service is no longer running, it is unplayable.
