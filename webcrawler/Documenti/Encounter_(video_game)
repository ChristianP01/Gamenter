Titolo: Encounter (video game)

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Encounter (also known as Encounter!) is a first person shoot 'em up game released in 1983 for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 programmed by Paul Woakes for Novagen Software. It was published by Novagen in the UK and Europe and by Synapse in North America. The gameplay is similar to that of Atari, Inc.'s 1980 arcade game Battlezone, but with large, sometimes screen-filling, scaled bitmaps instead of wireframe models.Versions for the Amiga and Atari ST computers followed much later, in 1991. It was also re-released by Atlantis Software for the Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 as a cassette budget title.
