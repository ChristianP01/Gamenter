Titolo: Horse Racing (video game)

Anno: 1980

Descrizione: Horse Racing is an equestrian video game released by Mattel Electronics for its Intellivision video game console in 1980.  Although primarily a sports video game, Horse Racing received Mattel's "Gaming Network" branding, due to its pari-mutuel betting on horses during the game.
The game houses 8 virtual Thoroughbred race horses residing in the fictional Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables at a fictional western Kentucky race track called Plympton Downs (based loosely on long-time sportscaster/Intellivision sales personality George Plimpton).  Each of the horses have differing racing abilities (front runner, pace keeper, come from behind, ...), and do vary from game time to game time (a horse with come from behind traits during one match may have front runner abilities during the next match).  These horses are known by their colors (instead of their post position numbersâ€”unlike in regular horse racing).
Horse Racing was also released by Sears for their Intellivision private-label clone, the Super Video Arcade.
