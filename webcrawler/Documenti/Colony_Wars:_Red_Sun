Titolo: Colony Wars: Red Sun

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Colony Wars: Red Sun (called Colony Wars III: Red Sun in North America) is a space combat simulator video game for the PlayStation developed by Psygnosis and published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and Midway Games in 2000. It is a sequel to Colony Wars in 1997 and Colony Wars: Vengeance in 1998. Instead of being a starfighter pilot for the League of Free Worlds or the Colonial Navy, the player now assumes the role of a civilian miner-turned-mercenary.
The game was originally set for release in North America by Psygnosis in April 2000, before it was delayed twice, once to late April or early May, and then to June 1 after being picked up by Midway Games.
