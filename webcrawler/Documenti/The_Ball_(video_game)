Descrizione: The Ball is a 2010 first-person action-adventure game developed by Teotl Studios and published by Tripwire Interactive.
The game was one of the OnLive's UK launch titles, and one of the 13 games contained in the Potato Sack Bundle, which was a part of the Potato Sack Alternate Reality Game, promoting Portal 2's release.
On June 7, 2016 a spiritual successor, The Solus Project was released on PC and consoles by Teotl and Grip Digital. The game features a very different setting, featuring an astronaut in the future stranded on an alien world, but the games share a universe and some themes.
