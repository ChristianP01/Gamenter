Titolo: Half-Life 2: Episode Two

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Half-Life 2: Episode Two is a first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve. Following Episode One (2006), it is the second of two shorter episodic games that continue the story of Half-Life 2 (2004). Players control Gordon Freeman, who travels through the mountains surrounding City 17 to a resistance base with his ally Alyx Vance. Like previous games in the series, Episode Two combines shooting, puzzle-solving and narrative elements, but adds expansive environments and less linear sequences.
Episode Two was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows on Valve's distribution service Steam, and as a part of The Orange Box, a compilation of Valve games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PlayStation version was produced by Electronic Arts. Episode Two received positive reviews.
A third Half-Life 2 episode was announced for Christmas 2007, but was canceled as Valve abandoned episodic development. In 2020, after canceling several further Half-Life projects, Valve released the prequel Half-Life: Alyx.
