Titolo: Carrier Air Wing (video game)

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Carrier Air Wing, released in Japan as U.S. Navy (ユー・エス・ネイビー, Yū Esu Neibī), is a 1990 side-scrolling shooting game released for the CP System arcade hardware by Capcom. It is the spiritual successor to U.N. Squadron, which was released in the previous year. As with the original, players chose any one of three different jet fighters and battle their way through ten enemy-packed stages. Other ideas carried over from U.N. Squadron include the shop, which allows players to buy weapon and shield upgrades for their jet fighter between stages, and the energy bar, which is replaced by a "fuel bar" which starts full at the start of each stage and decreases as time passes with some fuel lost each time the plane is damaged. The game has two different endings, depending on whether you finish the game with only one coin or not. A version for the Capcom Power System Changer was planned and previewed but never released.
