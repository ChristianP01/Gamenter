Descrizione: Golf is a golf-based sports simulation video game developed and released by Nintendo in 1984 for the Famicom in Japan. Later the same year, it was ported to the Nintendo VS. System as VS. Golf or Stroke and Match Golf, released in arcades internationally, followed by another arcade version called VS. Ladies Golf. The original was re-released for the NES in North America in 1985, and for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 in Japan.
The game was re-released across many years for different Nintendo consoles. It was previously a hidden Easter egg in the Nintendo Switch firmware as a tribute to the game's programmer, the late Satoru Iwata.
