Titolo: Gekirindan

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Gekirindan is a 1995 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game originally developed and published by Taito in Japan, America and Europe. Set in the year 3195, where a robot known as "Huge Boss" stole a newly developed time machine to travel back in time and rewrite human history, players assume the role of one of the six fighter pilots taking control of their own space fighter craft in an effort to overthrow the evil entity from altering history.
Headed by Snow Bros. and Twin Hawk composer Osamu ÅŒta, Gekirindan was created by some members of Toaplan at Taito after the former company declared bankruptcy in 1994. Initially launched for the arcades, the game later received a conversion for the Sega Saturn by Japan Media Programming and published exclusively in Japan by Virgin Interactive Entertainment on 18 April, 1997, featuring multiple changes compared with the original version. The title has since been re-released through compilations such as Taito Legends 2 across various platforms in 2006. The title has been met with mixed critical reception from reviewers.
