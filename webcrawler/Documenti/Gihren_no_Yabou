Descrizione: Gihren's Greed (Japanese: ギレンの野望, Hepburn: Giren no Yabō), is a series of turn-based strategy video games produced by Bandai, based on the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. It takes its gameplay style from the SD Gundam series and adds political and military management to the One Year War. The Japanese title, Giren no Yabō, is derived from that of Nobunaga's Ambition, although the English title uses a different translation for the word yabō.
