Titolo: Legends of Wrestling II

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Legends of Wrestling II is a professional wrestling video game developed by Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City, published by Acclaim Entertainment, and released on November 26, 2002 for both the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It was later released for the Xbox on December 5, 2002. It is the sequel to the 2001 professional wrestling video game Legends of Wrestling. Legends II contains 25 wrestlers that were not in the first game, though also excludes Rob Van Dam, presumably because he had recently been signed to a WWE contract. The game did contain Eddie Guerrero, however, who, although unemployed at the time, re-signed with WWE when the game was released. The game was also released on the Game Boy Advance on November 25, 2002. It was the last game developed by Acclaim's Salt Lake City studio before its closure in December 2002. A sequel, Showdown: Legends of Wrestling, was released in 2004.
The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions included video interviews with many of the legends featured in the game while the European version of the game included four exclusive additional legends from the United Kingdom: Kendo Nagasaki, Big Daddy, Mick McManus, and Giant Haystacks.
