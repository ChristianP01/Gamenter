Titolo: Bikini Karate Babes

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Bikini Karate Babes is a 2002 2D fighting video game that uses digitized graphics, developed by Creative Edge Studios. It features an all-female cast of 19 fighters, all clad in bikinis and played by real actresses. The game was developed as a response to the treatment of women in contemporary fighting games, who would be portrayed in skimpy, sexualized clothing while male characters were fully dressed.
The game received strongly negative reviews, with a 8.5% aggregate score on GameRankings and a 1.5 out of 10 from IGN. Nonetheless, its developer Creative Edge Studios referred to it as a "solid seller". A sequel, Bikini Karate Babes 2: Warriors of Elysia, was released in 2011.
