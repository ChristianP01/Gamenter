Titolo: Mosaic (murder mystery)

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Mosaic is a 2017 murder mystery by Steven Soderbergh, producer Casey Silver, and writer Ed Solomon, published via HBO.  It was released in two forms: as an iOS/Android mobile app and as a 2018 television drama.  The app works like an interactive film; while the user cannot affect the plot, they can choose from which perspective the same plot is viewed, and learn different facets of it.  Users can also investigate on their own time background documents, emails, news clippings, voice mails, police reports, and the like in a "Discoveries" option.
HBO released Mosaic as a six-episode television series in January 2018.  The television series contains largely the same content as the app, but without the interactivity or the ability to research documents, and is slightly shorter.
