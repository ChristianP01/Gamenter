Titolo: Cosmo Gang the Video

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Cosmo Gang the Video is a 1992 fixed shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco. A home conversion for the Super Famicom was released the same year. Controlling the Hyper Beat starship, the player is tasked with ridding the galaxy of the Cosmo Gang, a race of aliens that cause mischief across Earth. Gameplay involves shooting enemies and avoiding projectiles. Power-up items can be collected to grant the player additional abilities. It ran on the Namco System 2 arcade board.
Cosmo Gang the Video features characters and ideas from Cosmo Gangs, an older Namco redemption game from 1990 that was exported outside Japan by Data East. The game is heavily based on the company's own Galaxian series, with early versions shown at tradeshows being titled Cosmo Galaxian. The arcade version of Cosmo Gang the Video was widely successful and well-received for its graphics, gameplay and music, while the Super Famicom was met with a more mixed response for its simplistic gameplay and lacking replay value. The arcade version was digitally re-released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2009. It was followed by Cosmo Gang the Puzzle later that same year.
