Titolo: Skate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Skate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble is a skateboarding themed action/adventure video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Unlike the NES port of the original Skate or Die!, which was developed by Konami and published by their Ultra Games subsidiary, the sequel was developed internally and published by Electronic Arts themselves, serving as their second and last self-published NES game following The Immortal. Skate or Die 2 is well known for successfully using digitized vocals and electric guitar in the opening theme (composed, along with the rest of the game's music, by Rob Hubbard), rarely heard on the NES. 
The skater seen on the cover art is Jef Whitehead, who would years later become known for being the sole member of the black metal project Leviathan.
