Descrizione: The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock is a 1994 side scrolling action video game by Taito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The story of the game is generally based on the 1960s The Flintstones cartoon series. The title is a reference to the 1927 novel The Treasure of the Sierra Madre by B. Traven and its 1948 film adaptation.
In the opening story of the game, the Water Buffalos' leader decides to retire. As his last decree as Great Poobah, he makes a contest in which whoever finds the Treasure of Sierra Madrock will be his successor. In the game, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble must find the treasure before any other Buffalo member (or even their wives, Wilma and Betty). The game features passwords to continue the game from the highest level reached.
