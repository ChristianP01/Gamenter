Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Omega Boost (オメガブースト, Omega Būsuto) is a three dimensional shoot 'em up developed by Polyphony Digital for the PlayStation. It was released in 1999 throughout Japan, North America, and Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment.
The game features mecha designs by Shoji Kawamori of Macross fame.
Being released late in the PlayStation's life, Omega Boost is said to have some of the best graphics on the console with parts of the game running at 60 frame/s. The game was criticized by some reviewers for being too short (Nine levels with nine unlockable special missions) and simplistic. However, it is still considered one of the best Macross-style mecha simulation games produced and is thought of by many as a sleeper hit due to its poor marketing.
