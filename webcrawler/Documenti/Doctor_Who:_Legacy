Titolo: Doctor Who: Legacy

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Doctor Who: Legacy was a match-3 puzzle RPG video game released on 27 November 2013 and based upon the BBC television programme Doctor Who. The game was developed by American company Seed Studio in collaboration with British company Tiny Rebel Games. It is a free-to-play game released to coincide with the 50th Anniversary of the popular sci-fi show, with rights licensed by BBC Worldwide. The game launched focusing on the Eleventh Doctor (played by Matt Smith), then later shifted the focus to the Twelfth Doctor (played by Peter Capaldi), following his debut in the show. New characters and content were added to the game regularly upon them being "signed off" with both the actors and the BBC brand team.  The game includes every incarnation of the Doctor from the television series (including the War Doctor) and well over 200 companions from both classic and modern Doctor Who.  The game closely followed series 8 and series 9 of the show with new levels launching each weekend alongside each episode and included new characters, costumes, and enemies from most of the episodes.
The game also contains content which does not come from the television series but rather from expanded universe canon from Big Finish Productions audio series, Titan Comics comic books, and George Mann's Engines of War novel.  The game also has a side story entitled "Bigger on the Inside" which uses the retro 8-bit style art of PixelWho and follows the story of the TARDIS being infected by a virus. The game was closed down on 17 February 2019 as Tiny Rebel did not want to renew the license with the BBC.
