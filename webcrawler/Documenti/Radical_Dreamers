Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai H≈çseki is a 1996 text-based adventure video game developed and published by Square for the Satellaview, a satellite peripheral for the Super Famicom. It forms part of the Chrono series, acting as a side story to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. The game centers around an infiltration carried out by the titular thief gang led by Kid; aided by Serge and Gil, she seeks an artifact called the Frozen Flame and revenge on its keeper Lord Lynx. Players navigate the mansion's environments and impact the story's progression through text choices.
Chrono Trigger writer Masato Kato both directed and wrote the main scenario. Due to his attitude at the time, the plot and tone were considerably darker than Chrono Trigger, though the additional scenarists wrote alternate scenarios with comedic tones. The music was scored by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had worked on Chrono Trigger. Production was completed in three months, and Kato was left unsatisfied with its quality.
As with most Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers did not receive a lasting commercial release, and was exclusive to Japan. Attempts to bundle the game with the PlayStation port of Chrono Trigger were stopped by Kato due to quality concerns. The ROM for the game was released onto the web, allowing for the production of an English fan translation. While limited, its coverage in news and fan sites have praised its narrative and tone. Kato would later use plot elements from Radical Dreamers in his next game Chrono Cross.
