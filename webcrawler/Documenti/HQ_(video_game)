Titolo: HQ (video game)

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: HQ is a trivia video game developed by Intermedia Labs for iOS, Android, iPadOS, and tvOS. First released in 2017, the HQ app allows users to play in daily live trivia games, through which they can win or split prize money. HQ was developed by Vine creators Rus Yusupov and Colin Kroll, and credited as a production of Intermedia Labs. The app's original game was HQ Trivia, in which players have 10 seconds to answer multiple-choice questions that incrementally increase in difficulty. Additional games, such as HQ Words and HQ Tunes, were added later.
On February 14, 2020, the company that owned HQ Trivia sent a memo to staff that "effective today, HQ will cease operations and move to dissolution." However, four days later, Yusupov said that he had a tentative deal in place with another company to purchase the HQ franchise and keep it operational. On March 29, HQ Trivia resumed its daily games.
