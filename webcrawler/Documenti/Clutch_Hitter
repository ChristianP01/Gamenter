Descrizione: Clutch Hitter is a baseball video game released by Sega in 1991. It was released in video arcades as well for Sega's portable Game Gear. The Japanese version of the game features players and teams from Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league. The American version of the game sports a license from the Major League Baseball Players Association and has rosters composed of actual professional baseball players, but only city names for the teams since it was not licensed by Major League Baseball. In the arcade game, the on-field perspective is from behind home plate while the viewpoint in the Game Gear version is from the pitcher's mound, just as in Bases Loaded. In the Game Gear game, the number of innings can be chosen and linking to another Game Gear is possible for multiplayer gameplay.
