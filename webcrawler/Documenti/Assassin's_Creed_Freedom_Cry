Titolo: Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Assassin's Creed Freedom Cry is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft. Set in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) between 1735 and 1737, Freedom Cry follows Adéwalé, a prominent supporting character from the 2013 title Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. While attempting to disrupt Templar activities in the Caribbean Sea on behalf of their rival organization, the Brotherhood of Assassins, Adéwalé finds himself shipwrecked in Saint-Domingue, where he comes face-to-face with brutal slavery practices in the West Indies. 
The title was originally released in December 2013 as Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag — Freedom Cry, a post-launch downloadable content (DLC) expansion pack for Black Flag. A standalone version that does not require Black Flag was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Windows in February 2014. In December 2019, Freedom Cry was re-released on the Nintendo Switch as part of a compilation titled Assassin's Creed: The Rebel Collection, which also includes the base game of Black Flag and its successor, Assassin's Creed Rogue. The story campaign of Freedom Cry, which takes place thirteen years after the events of Black Flag, is loosely connected to its narrative but retains most of its core gameplay mechanics. Writer Jill Murray served as the lead writer for Freedom Cry, while French musician Olivier Derivière composed the game's soundtrack, replacing Brian Tyler, the composer employed for the base game. 
The Xbox One version received favorable reviews from video game publications, whereas the overall reception for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360 versions were less positive. Critics generally praised the game's storytelling and the decision to focus on an already established side character, but were disappointed by its short length and the lack of substantial gameplay improvements over Black Flag. Freedom Cry has been retrospectively assessed as a notable depiction of the slave narrative genre in the video game medium.
