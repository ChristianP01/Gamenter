Titolo: The Last Remnant

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: The Last Remnant (ラストレムナント, Rasuto Remunanto) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix. It was released worldwide for Xbox 360 in November 2008 and for Microsoft Windows in March 2009. A PlayStation 3 version was originally announced as well, but this version was cancelled. A remastered version was released on PlayStation 4 in December 2018 and for Nintendo Switch in June 2019. The game follows a teenage warrior on a quest to end the war, in a fictional world divided into multiple city-states and inhabited by four different species. Their past includes a conflict over "Remnants", magical artifacts of varying forms. The game features a unique battle system in which the player commands multiple groups, or "unions", of characters rather than individual units.
The Last Remnant is the first Square Enix game to use the Unreal Engine. It was intended by Square Enix president Yoichi Wada to "become a cornerstone for [their] worldwide strategy". The game's soundtrack was released as a three-disc album, composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito and Yasuhiro Yamanaka. The design and dialogue of the game were created to appeal to players worldwide, and motion capture for every character with the English-speaking dialogue. The game received a weak reception, though it was received more positively by Japanese reviewers than other ones. A common complaint, especially for Xbox 360, was of graphical problems including low framerates and "texture pop-in" where higher resolution textures would suddenly replace lower ones several seconds after a scene had started. Other issues included complaints about the game's storyline and battle system, though these were not as universal. The game received praise for art direction and music.
