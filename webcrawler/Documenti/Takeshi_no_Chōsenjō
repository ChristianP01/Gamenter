Descrizione: Takeshi no Chōsenjō (たけしの挑戦状, lit. Takeshi's Letter of Challenge), officially translated as The Ultimate Challenge from Beat Takeshi and popularly known as Takeshi's Challenge, is a 1986 Japanese action-adventure video game developed by Taito for the Family Computer (known internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System). The game was designed by entertainer Takeshi Kitano and is centered on a salaryman who seeks a treasure on a remote island in the South Seas. Takeshi no Chōsenjō has been negatively received in retrospect due to its unreasonable gameplay requirements that are difficult to clear without foresight.
