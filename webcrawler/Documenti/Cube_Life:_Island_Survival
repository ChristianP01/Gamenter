Titolo: Cube Life: Island Survival

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Cube Life: Island Survival is an indie open world sandbox survival video game developed and published by Cypronia. It was released for Wii U in June 2015. An HD remake was released for Steam in April 2018, for Android and iOS in August 2018, and for Nintendo Switch in December 2020.
The game was one of the first sandbox video games released for the Wii U. This has been seen as a niche in the market and is sometimes regarded as one of the main reasons for its relatively large success for an indie Minecraft clone.
