Titolo: Mari0

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Mari0 (pronounced "mari-zero" or "Mario") is a 2012 side-scrolling platform video game developed by German indie developer Maurice Guégan and released onto his website Stabyourself.net. It combines gameplay elements from Nintendo's Super Mario series and Valve's Portal series. The game features Mario armed with a "Portal Gun", the main game mechanic in the Portal series, allowing him to create two inter-spatial portals on 2-dimensional surfaces, which can transport himself, enemies and other objects through them. It was made with the LÖVE framework.
Beginning development in 2011, it was intended to be a direct port of the original Super Mario Bros. with the 4-player multiplayer system used in New Super Mario Bros. Wii - after Guégan viewed a Dorkly video titled Mario With A Portal Gun, the game was modified to include elements from the Portal series. The game quickly gained traction through online blogs and news sites, and has been downloaded nearly 1.6 million times. It was well-received by critics for its creativity and simplistic concept. An update to the game titled Mari0: Special Edition was planned for release at an unknown date, however it was cancelled in 2015 following technical constraints.
