Titolo: Hardware: Online Arena

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Hardware: Online Arena is an online multiplayer game that focuses on vehicular destruction using varying means such as missiles, lasers and machine guns. The game was released for PlayStation 2 with the launch of online play for the console and was thus arguably the first online game for PlayStation 2. The game was not a huge commercial success, selling very little. To boost sales, the game was added onto the network access disk that came with the purchase of the network adaptor and, as a result, the game was one of the three most popular games played online during 2003, having over 200 users on at any one time. GamesMaster said the game was, "A great indicator of the shape of things to come for PS2 online."
A spin-off game on the PlayStation Portable was released in 2005 under the name Fired Up. A PlayStation 4 game based on the original called Hardware: Rivals was released as a PlayStation Plus exclusive beta on the PlayStation Network on 29 September 2015.
