Titolo: Kwik Snax

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Kwik Snax is an arcade style maze video game play developed by the Oliver Twins and was published in 1990 by Codemasters for the Amstrad, Spectrum, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, and Amiga. It was the fifth game in the Dizzy series and is considered a sequel to Fast Food.
After the Oliver twins had completed Operation Gunship they wanted to release another puzzle game similar to Fast Food which only required two weeks of development time, but unexpectedly it required much more time.
The Rear cover (Amstrad Version) says "Dizzy to the rescue! Outwit Zaks' court jesters, bumble bees, clockwork mice and more in the Land of Personality. Mega features and fantastic fun in the incredibly playable, action packed, arcade puzzle game!"
