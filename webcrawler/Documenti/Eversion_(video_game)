Titolo: Eversion (video game)

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Eversion is a short platform game for Microsoft Windows by British indie studio Zaratustra Productions. It features a small flower-like protagonist named Zee Tee, who is on a quest to rescue a princess named Nehema from the evil Ghulibas of the North, collecting gems along the way, much like in the plot of early Mario games. Each level consists of a set of parallel realities, each of which features different hazards, a unique artistic style, and a distinctive soundtrack. By using Zee Tee's ability to "evert" from one reality to another, the player can navigate him through obstacles to reach his goal.
The opening screen and the first few levels are quite cheerful and colorful, but the environment becomes gradually more deranged and disturbing as the player progresses into other levels of the game. Eversion was inspired by a quotation from H. P. Lovecraft, and it features a warning on the intro screen that it is "not intended for children or those of a nervous disposition".
