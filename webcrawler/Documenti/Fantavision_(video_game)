Descrizione: Fantavision (Japanese: ファンタビジョン, Hepburn: Fantabijon) is a 2000 puzzle video game developed and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, which released as a launch title for the PlayStation 2. It is a real-time puzzle video game involving fireworks. It relies on quick color matching and symbol recognition skills.
Fantavision originally started out as a tech demo for the PlayStation 2, but it surprised many as it was released as an actual game. Initially, the game was released in Japan, only featuring single-player mode. The American and European (and later the updated version released in Japan called Futari no Fantavision) releases of the game, which were launch titles, were released with two-player mode support. The game was also released for the PlayStation 4 via emulation in December 2015.
