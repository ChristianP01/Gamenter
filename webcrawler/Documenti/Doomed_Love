Titolo: Doomed Love

Anno: 2021

Descrizione: Doomed Love is a point-and-click visual novel released on Itch.io on June 11, 2021, that serves as an unofficial adaptation of the 1993 video game Doom (created by John Carmack, John Romero, Adrian Carmack, Kevin Cloud, and Tom Hall) as a dating sim. It was programmed, illustrated, and composed by Scottish cartoonist David B. Cooper, with an updated version releasing June 18. The game was designed in response to a Tweet received by Cooper in response to "cute" fan art he had drawn of Doom's demon characters, deriding the original Doom series as "too violent" by comparison to the fan art. Recurring The Simpsons character Lenny Leonard is also included in the game, in reference to "Sad Springfield" fan art of Cooper's which had gone viral earlier that year. The fangame has received positive critical reception, with Doom co-creator John Romero praising the game and his own inclusion in it.
