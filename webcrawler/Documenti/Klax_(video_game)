Titolo: Klax (video game)

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Klax is a puzzle video game released in arcades in 1990 by Atari Games while Namco distributed the game in Japanese markets. It was designed by Dave Akers and Mark Stephen Pierce. The object is to catch colored blocks tumbling down a machine and arrange them in colored rows and patterns to make them disappear. Klax was originally published as a coin-op follow-up to Tetris, about which Atari Games was in a legal dispute at the time.
The Atari 2600 version, released in mid 1990, and Fatal Run, are the final releases for the console which was discontinued in early 1992.
