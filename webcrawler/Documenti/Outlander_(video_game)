Titolo: Outlander (video game)

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Outlander is an action driving video game with a post-apocalyptic theme. It was developed and published by Mindscape in 1992 for the Mega Drive/Genesis and in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was originally developed under the title The Road Warrior, based on the film of the same name; however, Mindscape lost the rights to the license when the game was almost complete, so the title was changed to Outlander to avoid legal issues.
