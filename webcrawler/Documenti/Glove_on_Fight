Titolo: Glove on Fight

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Glove on Fight (グローブオンファイト, Gurōbu on Faito) is a doujin boxing video game released at the Comic Revolution 31 convention in May 2002 by Watanabe Seisakujo (now French-Bread). The name of the game is a take on "Groove on Fight", which is a sequel of the Power Instinct series, though other than that the two games have very little in common. The game was developed to test routines that the programmer would use in Melty Blood.
