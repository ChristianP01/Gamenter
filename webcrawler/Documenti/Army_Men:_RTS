Descrizione: Army Men: RTS is a real-time strategy video game developed by Pandemic Studios and published by The 3DO Company for PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows and GameCube. In this game, Sarge, his heroes and the Green Army are hungry to put an end to their nemesis once and for all, the tyrannical Tan army, battling them in 15 campaigns missions, 8 special operation missions and 8 great battles in The 3DO Company's farewell to this series. The Greenies hit dirt paths, linoleum floors and carpets and weave through flower beds, strewn boxes and toy train sets to collect plastic and electricity to build snipers to clear the field from afar or amass an army that overwhelms the opposition. The game is loosely based on the movie Apocalypse Now, where the good guys hunt down an insane colonel, here Colonel Blintz.
