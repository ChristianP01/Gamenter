Titolo: Fonz (video game)

Anno: 1976

Descrizione: Road Race is a 1976 car driving arcade racing video game developed and released by Sega in February 1976. Later the same year, Sega released two motorbike racing variants, Man T.T. (released in August) and Moto-Cross, which were in turn re-branded as Fonz, in a customized arcade cabinet released by Sega-Gremlin in November 1976. The game was based on the character Fonzie from the 1970s TV show Happy Days, with the slogan being "TV's hottest name, Your hottest game." Sega was allowed to rebrand their game as Fonz because its American branch at the time was owned by Charles Bluhdorn's Gulf+Western Company and thus had access to Paramount Television's intellectual property.
A two-player version of Man T.T. called Twin Course T.T. was released in January 1977.
