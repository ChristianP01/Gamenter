Titolo: Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage is an action video game developed by Viacom New Media (a then-sister company to Nickelodeon, who had broadcast Looney Tunes cartoons at the time of the game's release) and published by Sunsoft released exclusively for the SNES in 1994. The player controls Bugs Bunny as he fights traditional Looney Tunes villains in order to confront the main villain of the story, animator Daffy Duck. The game's title is derived from the 1955 animated short of the same name, which follows a similar plot of Bugs at the mercy of an antagonistic animator, revealed to be Elmer Fudd. The characters in the game were voiced by Greg Burson.
