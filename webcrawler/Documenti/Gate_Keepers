Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Gate Keepers (ゲートキーパーズ, Gēto Kīpāzu) is a Tactical role-playing game developed by Entertainment Software Publishing and published by Kadokawa Shoten for the PlayStation. The game was then adapted into a manga series written by Hiroshi Yamaguchi and drawn by Keiji Gotoh and an anime series produced by Gonzo, and first aired on April 3, 2000. A six episode original video animation (OVA) sequel, Gate Keepers 21, was released in 2002. The main characters in the OVA sequel were the next generation of Gate Keepers.
All Gate Keepers series follow the same basic premise and share most of their characters, with some major discrepancies (mainly involving the character Reiji Kageyama). A character from the game, Francine Allumage is completely absent from the anime. Another character from the game Misao Sakamori, was replaced in the anime with the new original character Megumi Kurogane (though Misao does make a guest appearance towards the end of the anime).
