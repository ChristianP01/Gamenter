Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Frogger, also called Frogger: He's Back!, is an action video game remake of Konami's 1981 arcade game of the same name. It was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment's SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Hasbro Interactive in November 1997. The game is an expansion of the original arcade game, sporting levels with large maps, an updated set of graphics rendered in 3D, and additional gameplay moves. Critical reaction was mixed, with frequent criticism towards the gameplay, controls, and difficulty, while the graphics were received positively. It was a commercial success, with the PlayStation version going on to become one of the best-selling titles for the console. The Sega Genesis, SNES, Game.com, Game Boy, and Game Boy Color versions of the original Frogger game also feature the box art of this game.
In 2000, Frogger was followed by Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge, which builds on the gameplay elements found in the game.
