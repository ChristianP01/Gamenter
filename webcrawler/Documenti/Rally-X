Titolo: Rally-X

Anno: 1980

Descrizione: Rally-X is a maze chase arcade game developed and released by Namco in 1980. Players control a blue Formula One racecar through a series of multi-scrolling levels and must collect yellow flags scattered about. There are enemy red cars that pursue the player in an attempt to collide with them, and there are also boulders that must be avoided. Red cars can be temporarily stunned by laying down smoke screens at the cost of a portion of their fuel.
Rally-X was designed as a successor to Sega's Head On (1979), a similar maze chase game with cars. It was a commercial success in Japan, where it was the sixth highest-grossing arcade game of 1980, but Midway Manufacturing released the game in North America to largely underwhelming results. The game is best known in North America for an often-repeated, though untrue, story involving its demonstration at the 1980 Amusement & Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, where the attending press believed Rally-X was of superior quality than the other games presented, specifically Pac-Man. Though it was well-received by attendees, Rally-X failed to attract much attention during its presentation.
Reception for Rally-X, both at release and retrospectively, has highlighted its technological accomplishments and high difficulty. Some reviewers have found it to be influential and ahead of its time. Rally-X received several remakes and sequels, beginning with New Rally-X in 1981, and is also included in several Namco compilations. It is credited as one of the first games to implement bonus stages and continuously-playing background music.
