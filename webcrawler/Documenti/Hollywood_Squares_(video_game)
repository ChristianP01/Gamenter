Titolo: Hollywood Squares (video game)

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Hollywood Squares is a multiplatform puzzle game based on the television game show of the same name. Versions were also released for MS-DOS, Commodore 64 and Apple II home computers, and look a bit different from the NES counterpart. The photo of the set on both the NES and computer versions is from the 1985 series pilot (the actual show had no gold stars on the studio floor and more elaborate risers for the cars). The game is based on the 1986-1989 version hosted by John Davidson.
