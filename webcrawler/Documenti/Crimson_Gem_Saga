Titolo: Crimson Gem Saga

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Crimson Gem Saga is a role-playing video game developed for the PlayStation Portable and iOS. It was developed by South Korean studio IRONNOS and published in Korea by SK Telecom as Astonishia Story 2. It was released in North America on May 26, 2009 by Atlus under the title Crimson Gem Saga, and was released in Japan under the title Garnet Chronicle by Sega.
The game is set in the world of Latein, where, unbeknownst to the public, an artifact formerly known as the Crimson Gem is being sought. One of the parties caught up in the whirlwind is Killian von Rohcoff, a recent graduate of the Green Hill Chevalier Academy, the game's protagonist. The game is a sequel in story to Astonishia Story, but since much of the game's mechanics were changed, the title in all regions was also changed.
