Titolo: Batman: Return of the Joker

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Batman: Return of the Joker is a 1991 platform video game, the follow-up to Sunsoft's first Batman game on the Nintendo Entertainment System.  Unlike that game, which was based on the 1989 Batman film directed by Tim Burton, Return of the Joker is entirely self-contained and based more on the modern comic book iteration of Batman. However, Batman rides the Batmobile and the Batwing from the 1989 film. A remake of Return of the Joker, titled Batman: Revenge of the Joker, was released on the Sega Genesis by Ringler Studios in 1992.  A Super NES version of Revenge of the Joker was completed but never officially released, however a ROM image surfaced online in later years.
A completely different version of the game was released on the Game Boy in 1992.
