Descrizione: The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd, known in Japan as The Legend of Heroes: Sora no Kiseki The 3rd, is a role-playing video game developed by Nihon Falcom. The game is a part of the Trails series, itself a part of the larger The Legend of Heroes series, and serves as the final entry of the Trails in the Sky sub-trilogy. Initially released in Japan in 2007 for Microsoft Windows, and later for the PlayStation Portable. The game did not see an English release until 2017 due to the game's large amount of text necessary to translate and localize. A high-definition port to the PlayStation 3 was released in 2013, while a remaster for the PlayStation Vita was released in 2016; both were only released in Japan.
