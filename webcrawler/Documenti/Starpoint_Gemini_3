Descrizione: Starpoint Gemini 3 is a space combat and role-playing video game developed by LGM Games, currently in early access mode and set for full release later in 2019. The game is the third instalment in the Starpoint Gemini series and a direct successor to Starpoint Gemini 2. Unlike the previous instalments, the game focuses on story-driven elements and aerial dogfights (which will introduce full-body NPC characters to interact with for the first time), cockpit view and modular upgrades of the ship. The story is written by Darko Macan. The game will use LGM's proprietary WhaleX game engine.
