Titolo: Quarky & Quaysoo's Turbo Science

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Quarky & Quaysoo's Turbo Science is an educational computer game developed by Jeff Tunnell Productions and published by Sierra On-Line for MS-DOS in early 1992. It was designed to teach scientific concepts to children.
The game centers on Quarky and Quaysoo O'Gandi, two space "elfs" that are green and yellow respectively. With the help of the player they race through a town in vehicles ranging from cars to jet packs. To purchase vehicles, the player answers questions relating to science at stops along the way. Each stop has a theme: the construction site is simple machines, Clown College is chemistry, etc. There are three opposing teams: two tough street fighters, a pair of alien siblings, and a know-it-all named Odessa King. The game also featured an information book that ran over one-hundred pages long and taught science topics such as optics (via a run-in with the light police) and energy (with the help of Sheik Oil Slick).
