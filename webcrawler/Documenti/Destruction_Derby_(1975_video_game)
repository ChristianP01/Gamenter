Titolo: Destruction Derby (1975 video game)

Anno: 1975

Descrizione: Destruction Derby is an arcade video game released by Exidy in 1975 as the company's first driving game. Exidy licensed it to Chicago Coin, who sold the game as Demolition Derby (not to be confused with Demolition Derby, a 1984 game by Bally Midway). Exidy stopped producing Destruction Derby to avoid competing with the licensed version, and instead developed a game with similar mechanics: the controversial Death Race.
