It is the first game in the Crash Bandicoot series not to have a Japanese release. It was the last game to be published by Vivendi before Activision merged with the company the following year.
Crash of the Titans is the fourteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series, and the sixth game in the main franchise. The game's story centers on the discovery of a substance known as "Mojo", which series antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and his niece Nina harvest to turn the inhabitants of the Wumpa Islands into an army of ferocious mutants known as "Titans". The protagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot, must stop Cortex and Nina by using the technique of "jacking" to take control of and destroy the Titans while collecting mojo; he must also rescue his sister Coco, who has been kidnapped and forced to help build a doomsday machine that will assist the Titans in Cortex and Nina's bid for world domination.
Crash of the Titans received mixed reviews upon release. Although the jacking concept, visuals, voice acting and humor were generally met positively, critics considered the combat to be repetitive and unbalanced, and criticized the nonadjustable camera. The Nintendo DS version received positive assessments for its gameplay variety and visuals, but was met with criticism for its controls. Despite this reception, the game was nominated for three awards.
