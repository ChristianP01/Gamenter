Descrizione: Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball (Japanese: デッドオアアライブエクストリームビーチバレーボール, Hepburn: Deddo Oa Araibu Ekusutorīmu Bīchi Barēbōru, abbreviated as DOAX) is a beach volleyball game by Tecmo released in 2003 exclusively for the Xbox. The game was a departure from the rest of the Dead or Alive series which otherwise consisted of fighting games. It also marked the first game in the series to have a Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board.
The game is set immediately after the tournament in Dead or Alive 3 ended. Gameplay revolves around the women of the DOA series playing various mini-games in the many locations of Zack Island, a reclusive private resort on an island owned by Zack, the only male character from the series to appear anywhere in the game. This installment features no fighting engine, instead being much like a simulation game that encourages the player to establish relationships with the AI of characters, and eventually make a two-person team to compete in volleyball competitions. Currency earned from completing mini-games and gambling in the island's casino allows the player to purchase hundreds of different swimsuits to wear in the game.
Its sequel, Dead or Alive Xtreme 2, was released on November 13, 2006, exclusively for the Xbox 360. The next sequel, Dead or Alive Xtreme 3, was released on March 24, 2016 in Asian countries.
