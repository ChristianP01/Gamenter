Descrizione: Wander is an adventure game by Peter Langston. It is one of the earliest text adventure video games in existence, predating Colossal Cave Adventure. The game was originally coded in BASIC. For a long time, the original files had been kept in an archived email by one of Langston's friends. The files now exist on GitHub. The game used a Mainframe computer with multiple databases to create the worlds that formed the game. The game was distributed in Langston's PSL Games collection for Unix.
