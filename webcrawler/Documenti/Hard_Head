Descrizione: Hard Head (stylized as HAP.D HEAD internationally) originally known in Korea as Dr. Bulgehead (hangul = 짱구 박사|RR = Jjang-gu Bagsa|MR = Jjang-gu Baksa). This is an obscure 2D side-scrolling platform game that was developed and produced by SunA Electronics in 1987, and internationally released only for the arcades in 1988 from South Korea to arcades worldwide.
Classical music is extensively used as the soundtrack for this game. Edited extracts from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake Op. 20 (1st movement), Mozart's 40th Symphony K. 550 (1st movement), and Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu Op. 66 can repeatedly be heard through the game.
