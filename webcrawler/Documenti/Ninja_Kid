The Japanese version was based on the manga series GeGeGe no Kitaro, but the game was changed to the generic "Ninja Kid" and all references to Kitaro were removed for the American version.This game was followed by a sequel titled Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen, which was released the following year only in Japan also by Bandai; however, that title was a role-playing video game and its plot is unrelated to the original.
It was the eighth best selling Famicom game of 1986, selling 1,250,000 copies.
