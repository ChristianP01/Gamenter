Descrizione: Snap-On Gearhead Garage: The Virtual Mechanic is a PC game where players repair and customize late model cars and trucks.  It was created by Mekada, endorsed by Snap-on Tools, and published in 1999 by Head Games (subsequently acquired by Activision).  There is no feature for driving the cars but Gearhead Garage introduced an entirely new "bolt-em up" paradigm.  The appeal is reminiscent of taking things apart in real lifeâ€”players can completely disassemble the engine, repair the individual parts, reassemble them, and then exhibit the completed result in their 3D "car lot".  The game also features a series of "jobs", wherein the player fixes vehicles owned by fictional characters.  This allows them to earn money to buy custom items from the catalog, auction, or junkyard.
