Descrizione: Caller's Bane (originally named Scrolls) is a strategy digital collectible card game developed by Mojang Studios, which aims to combine elements from trading card games and traditional board games. Scrolls was originally conceived and developed by Jakob Pors√©r, who along with Mojang founder Markus Persson, intended to create a type of game that was currently missing from the market. The game is developed using the Unity game engine, allowing it to run on multiple gaming platforms. Scrolls  was announced on 2 March 2011, as Mojang Studios' second game. While Mojang had claimed that they stopped development of the game in June 2015, the company revealed that they had still been working on the project, and in June 2018, released the game under its new title Caller's Bane for free.
