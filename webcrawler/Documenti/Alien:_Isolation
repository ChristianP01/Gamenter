Titolo: Alien: Isolation

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Alien: Isolation is a 2014 survival horror video game developed by Creative Assembly and  published by Sega originally for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. Based on the Alien film series, the game is set 15 years after the events of the original 1979 film Alien, and follows engineer Amanda Ripley, daughter of Alien protagonist Ellen Ripley, as she investigates the disappearance of her mother. The game places an emphasis on stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid and outsmart a single Alien creature with tools such as a motion tracker and flamethrower.
Alien: Isolation was designed to resemble the original Alien film rather than its more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future would look like. The game runs on an engine built from scratch to accommodate the Alien's behaviour and technical aspects such as atmospheric and lighting effects. Creative Assembly intended to make Alien: Isolation a third-person game, but ultimately used first-person to create a more intense experience. Several downloadable content packs were released for the game, some of which relive scenes from the original film.
Alien: Isolation received generally positive reviews from critics and sold over two million copies by May 2015. The game's retro-futuristic art direction, sound design, and artificial intelligence were highlighted positively, while its characters and unforgiving gameplay received some criticism. The game appeared in multiple "Best of" lists and won several year-end awards, including Best Audio at the 2015 Game Developers Choice Awards and Audio Achievement at the 11th British Academy Games Awards. It was ported to Linux and OS X in 2015, to Nintendo Switch in 2019, and to Android and iOS mobile devices in 2021. The game was also added to the Amazon Luna service in 2021.
