Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Crash: Mind over Mutant is a platform  video game developed by Radical Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable (ported by Virtuos), Wii and Xbox 360. The Nintendo DS version of the game was developed by TOSE. It was released in North America on October 7, 2008 and was later released in Europe and Australia on October 29 and October 31 respectively. It is the second game in the series not to have a Japanese release, after Crash of the Titans. It is the first game in the franchise to be published by Activision, released after the Vivendi merger and the last major console entry as a whole until Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, a remaster of the first three games, was released in 2017.
Crash: Mind over Mutant is the fifteenth installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series, and the seventh in the main franchise. The game's story centers on the arrival of a popular technological device (a parody of devices such as the iPhone and BlackBerry) that puts whoever uses it under the control of the device's creators, Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nitrus Brio.  Crash Bandicoot – protagonist of the series and only one unaffected by the device besides his spirit ally Aku Aku – must free his friends from the control of the device and put an end to Cortex and Brio's plot.
The title received an overall mixed response, with opinions varying from version to version. The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions were met with generally favorable  reviews, while the Xbox 360 version generated a less positive reaction. Much praise was reserved for the voice acting and the satirical humor of the game's narrative, cutscenes and dialogue, while the unadjustable camera and extensive backtracking were heavily criticised. The Nintendo DS version was received negatively for what critics described as dull and repetitive gameplay.
