Descrizione: Dungeon Fighter Online (DFO), known in South Korea as Dungeon & Fighter (DNF), is a multiplayer beat 'em up action role-playing game, developed and published for personal computers by Neople, a South Korean subsidiary of Nexon, and originally published by Hangame in 2005. The game was originally released in South Korea as Dungeon & Fighter, then in Japan as Arad Senki, and then published in China by Tencent. In 2014, Neople began an alpha test of a global version of Dungeon Fighter Online using the last English version hosted by Nexon, which has since ended.
DFO is one of the most-played and highest-grossing video games of all time, exceeding a total of 700 million players worldwide and having grossed over $15 billion in lifetime revenue as of May 2020. This also makes it one of the highest-grossing entertainment media products of all time. The game has received Japanese anime and manga adaptations. A spin-off fighting game, DNF Duel, is being developed by Neople, Arc System Works, and Eighting and is set for release in summer 2022.
