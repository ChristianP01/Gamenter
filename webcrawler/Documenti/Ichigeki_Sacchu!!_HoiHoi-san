Titolo: Ichigeki Sacchu!! HoiHoi-san

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: HoiHoi-san, full title Ichigeki Sacchu!! HoiHoi-san (一撃殺虫!!ホイホイさん, "One-Shot Bug Killer!! Interceptor Doll HoiHoi-san"), is a manga by Kunihiko Tanaka that spawned a PlayStation 2 game and a ten-minute OVA (sold with first printing of manga tankōbon).  In the year 20XX, insects have become immune to all pesticides.  To combat the rising plague of cockroaches and other household pests, the tiny, doll-like extermination gynoids known as "Hoihoi-san" were created.  They can hunt down insects and kill them with such miniaturized weapons as minuscule machine guns and tiny combat knives.  They can also (and at the same time) be treated as dolls, by dressing them up in costumes and buying accessories for them. The main robot of the anime wears a maid uniform and rabbit ears as accessories.
