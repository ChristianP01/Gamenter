Titolo: Far Gate

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Far Gate is a video game released for Microsoft Windows. It was developed by Super X Studios (formerly Thrushwave Technology) and published by Micro√Øds. The gameplay consists of 3D space-based real-time strategy, and allows players to play as any of three distinct factions employing different units and structures.  It was one of the first video games to offer fully 3D space-based real time strategy.
Under the title of The Rift, an early version of Far Gate was the winner of the Audience Choice Award at the 2000 Independent Games Festival. Despite this initial acclaim, however, its eventual retail release suffered from unfortunate timing issues and received mixed critical reviews.
