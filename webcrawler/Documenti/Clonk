Descrizione: Clonk is a single player and multiplayer video game series. The games feature a mix of the action, real-time strategy and platform game genres. Developed between 1994 and 2014 by RedWolf Design, the games of the series were originally released as shareware and became freeware and later open source software around 2008 and 2014. The game's community has since developed the series under the name OpenClonk. The series was compared and described as a mixture of Worms, The Settlers, Tetris, Lemmings and Minecraft. The game was noted for the easy game "extension" mechanic with an integrated editor and developer mode, which allows experienced players to create their own modifications directly into the game.
