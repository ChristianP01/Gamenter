Titolo: E-Type (video game)

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: E-Type is a clone of Sega's arcade driving game Out Run for the BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, and Acorn Archimedes. It was written by Gordon J. Key and published by The Fourth Dimension. Instead of the Ferrari from Out Run, the player drives a blue Jaguar E-type.
In addition to the game a separate track designer was released which allows players to make and save their own tracks. A pack of extra tracks entitled The Extra 100 Miles was available.
