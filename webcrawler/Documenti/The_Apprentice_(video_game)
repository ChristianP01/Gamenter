Titolo: The Apprentice (video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: The Apprentice is a 1994 vertically scrolling platform game developed by The Vision Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media in North America and Europe exclusively for the Philips CD-i. The first title to be created by The Vision Factory for the CD-i platform, the game is set on a fantasy setting inside the castle of wizard Gandorf S. Wandburner III, as players assume the role of young apprentice magician Marvin in order to complete a series of tasks given by his master while facing multiple mischiefs and creatures along the way.
Headed by Steel Machine artist Luke S. Verhulst alongside longtime God of War programmer Tim Moss, The Apprentice was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at SPC Vision and who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots before the company declared bankruptcy in 2002.
The Apprentice was met with positive critical reception from reviewers since its release, with praise towards the presentation, graphics, sound design and gameplay, though some reviewers drawing comparison with Dimo's Quest. In recent years, it has been referred by publications such as Retro Gamer to be one of the best titles for the system. A sequel was in development but it never released after multiple attempts.
