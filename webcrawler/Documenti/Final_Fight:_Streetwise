Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Final Fight: Streetwise is a 2006 3D beat-'em-up produced by Capcom, released in North America and the PAL region for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It is a sequel to Final Fight 3 developed by the American team of Capcom Production Studio 8 (the developers of Final Fight Revenge and the Maximo series). It is the fourth and final installment of the Final Fight series as well as the only Final Fight video game to not be released in Japan. An PlayStation Portable version was also planned but ultimately cancelled. 
The game returned the series to its beat-'em-up roots, casting players as Kyle Travers, brother of Cody from the first game. Series regulars Haggar and Guy also make appearances in the game's story mode, which has Kyle battling a maniacal priest named Father Bella and the illegal drug "glow".
