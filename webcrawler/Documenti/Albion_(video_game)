Descrizione: Albion is a single player role-playing video game developed and published by Blue Byte for MS-DOS in 1995. It was originally released in German, then translated to English for international release. The game uses a science fiction setting that incorporates traditional fantasy elements, such as magic.
The game was intended to be developed for the Amiga computer, but Commodore declared bankruptcy. Albion can be considered a spiritual successor to the Amiga role-playing video games Amberstar and Ambermoon, bearing very similar gameplay and developed by the same core team (Erik Simon - design, Jurie Horneman - code, Thorsten Mutschall - graphics, Matthias Steinwachs - sound and music, and Dieter Rottermund - artwork) under the Thalion Software name.The game was re-released in 2015 on Gog.com with support for Microsoft Windows.
