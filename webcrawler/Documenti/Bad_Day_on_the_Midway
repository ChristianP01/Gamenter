Titolo: Bad Day on the Midway

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Bad Day on the Midway is a CD-ROM game written and directed by The Residents, animated and designed by Jim Ludtke, developed and published by Inscape.
The game takes place in the titular Midway where the player first takes control of Timmy, an easily-amused 10-year-old boy, but is soon able to switch perspective and control to a number of different characters as they navigate through the fair. The goal isn't made very clear, as the game is considered first and foremost to be more of an interactive narrative and visual experience, but there are various ways to die during gameplay, and multiple endings can be achieved depending on which characters are left alive at the end of one in-game day.
The character Timmy was later brought back in a series of short videos by the Residents in 2006. In 2012, a novel was published based on the game's story, along with a CD of "reconsidered" music from the game's soundtrack.The game was optioned by Ron Howard at Imagine Television for a proposed series to be directed by David Lynch.  After two years of meetings with Lynch, the project was dropped because a script was never agreed upon. Had the project moved forward, The Residents would not have been creatively involved as their contract only gave them consulting roles in the pilot.
