Titolo: Momoko 120%

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Momoko 120% (モモコ120%, Momoko Hyakunijū Pāsento) is a 1986 arcade game by Jaleco released only in Japan. The game was originally intended to be an Urusei Yatsura game, but for an unknown reason the license was not obtained for the arcade version—while the characters were changed, "Lum's Love Song"—the first opening theme of the anime adaption, still loops throughout the game. However, the Family Computer port retained the license and was titled Urusei Yatsura: Lum's Wedding Bell. The game was re-released for mobile phones in Japan on February 28, 2006. Three mobile phone sequels, Momoko 1200%, Momoko 1200% in Machigai Sagashi and Momoko no Kasei Bowling ~La Mars Cup~, were released in Japan only in 2006.
