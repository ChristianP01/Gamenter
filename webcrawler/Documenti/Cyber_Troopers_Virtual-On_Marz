Descrizione: Cyber Troopers Virtual-On MARZ (電脳戦機バーチャロン マーズ, Dennō Senki Bācharon Māzu) is a 3D Mecha action-adventure game developed by Hitmaker and published by Sega. The game was first released on the PlayStation 2 in North America and Japan, and is the fourth game in the Virtual On franchise. MARZ expands upon the basic gameplay rules of Virtual-On Force, and reuses most of the game's assets; from the stages down to models of the Virtuaroids, the game's enemies.
MARZ was not well received, receiving many negative responses from reviewers and players alike. Some stores in North America, expecting poor sales, only sold the game to those who reserved it. The game was re-released on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on March 21, 2013, to commemorate the game's ten-year anniversary.
