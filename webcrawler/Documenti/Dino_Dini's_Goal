Titolo: Dino Dini's Goal

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Dino Dini's Goal is a soccer video game released by Virgin Games in 1993. It is considered by many to be the "true" sequel to Kick Off 2 (in preference to Kick Off 3), as Kick Off's creator Dino Dini had moved from Anco Software and was responsible for all Goal's engineering and game design. Goal introduced improved dynamics and A.I. over Kick Off 2, as well as other innovative features, such as multiple camera views. The game shipped 60,000 units on the first day of release.
