Titolo: Dreamscape (video game)

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Dreamscape (stylized as dream:scape) is a 2011 first-person adventure video game, with puzzle elements, developed and published by American studio Speedbump Studios. It was released worldwide on June 9, 2011 for iOS devices exclusively. The game does not follow traditional video game conventions, as it involves minimal interaction from the player and does not require choices to be made, and there are only basic puzzles for the player to complete. It instead places focus on its story, which is told through the perspective of a man called Wilson, who is caught in the limbo between life and death. Moments before his death, Wilson is transported to his own Dreamscape and is allowed to relive all his memories for one last time. While there he finally discovers the truth as to why his fiancee, Amelia, disappeared on the day of their wedding.
Dreamscape was developed over the course of three months by George Lippert, who also co-wrote the game's script and voiced all male characters. Carol Mertz and Lippert's son Zane provided the voices for all other characters. Lippert designed the game around a 3D cabin model he made while learning to use the Unreal Engine. While the game was initially set to be released in April 2011, the release date was pushed back two months in order to fix a memory bug that prevented it from running on certain devices.
Upon release Dreamscape received "mixed or average" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the narrative and sound design, but criticized the uninspiring gameplay and repetitive nature of the game. It also became the second game to run on iOS devices using Unreal Engine 3 after 2010's Infinity Blade.
