Titolo: Adventure Rock

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Adventure Rock (previously known as CBBC World) was a virtual online world for children based on Ketnetkick, and created by the BBC in association with Ketnet, owned and operated by the Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep (VRT), Flanders' public broadcaster. The game was originally aimed at the Belgian market, but was redeveloped for a UK audience of children aged between 6â€“12 years old. The emphasis on the system was on safety and responsibility, with no chatrooms or the financial aspects available in other online worlds such as Linden Lab's Second Life.Controller of CBBC Richard Deverell said:
[Adventure Rock] is a good example of the way we need to go. The thing that interests me is that children are at the vanguard. And that is where we are taking Children's BBC.
Adventure Rock was shut down in 2009 due to lack of popularity, updates and repairs.
