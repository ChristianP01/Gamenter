Descrizione: Brutal Sports Football is an arcade-style football video game developed by Teque London and originally published by Millennium Interactive for the Commodore Amiga in 1993. It is the first entry in the Brutal Sports Series franchise, which continued with Wild Cup Soccer in 1994, also from the same development team.
Featuring a different take on football, Brutal Sports Football puts heavy emphasis on the violent aspect of the sport and it resembles war as much as a sports competition. Initially released on the Amiga computers, it was later ported to MS-DOS, Amiga CD32 and Atari Jaguar, with the latter being published by Telegames instead and became the first third-party title released for the system. The Jaguar version was also released in Japan by Messe Sansao on July 1995.Brutal Sports Football received mostly positive reception since its release on the Amiga, with many reviewers favorably comparing it to Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe from The Bitmap Brothers.
