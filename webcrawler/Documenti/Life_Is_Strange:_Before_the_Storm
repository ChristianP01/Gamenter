Titolo: Life Is Strange: Before the Storm

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Life Is Strange: Before the Storm is an episodic graphic adventure video game developed by Deck Nine and published by Square Enix's European subsidiary. The three episodes were released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in late 2017 and the bonus episode was released for Deluxe Edition owners in March 2018. It is the second entry in the Life Is Strange series, set as a prequel to the original game, focusing on sixteen-year-old Chloe Price and her relationship with schoolmate Rachel Amber. Gameplay concerns itself mostly with the use of branching dialogues and interacting with the environment. It was ported to Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS in late 2018.
Deck Nine began developing the game in 2016, using the Unity game engine. Ashly Burch from the original game did not voice Chloe Price in Before the Storm because of the SAG-AFTRA strike, but reprised her role in a bonus episode once the strike was resolved. British indie band Daughter wrote and performed the score. Life Is Strange: Before the Storm received generally favourable reviews, praising the characters, themes, and story, while criticising aspects like plotholes, the main relationship, and the impact of player decisions near the end of the game.
A remastered version of the game will be released as part of the Life Is Strange Remastered Collection in early 2022.
