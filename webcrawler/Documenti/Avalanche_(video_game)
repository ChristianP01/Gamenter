Titolo: Avalanche (video game)

Anno: 1978

Descrizione: Avalanche is an arcade video game designed by Dennis Koble and released by Atari, Inc. in 1978. The object is to catch falling rocks with a controllable set of paddles that diminish in number and size as the rocks fall faster and faster.
The concept gained a much wider audience after Activision released an unauthorized adaptation in 1981 as Kaboom! for the Atari 2600.
The only official home port of Avalanche is for the Atari 8-bit family.
