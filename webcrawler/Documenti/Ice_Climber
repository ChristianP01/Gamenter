Descrizione: Ice Climber is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the arcade Nintendo VS. System in 1984 and the Nintendo Entertainment System console in 1985. In Ice Climber, the characters Popo and Nana (Pepe and Nana in the German version), collectively known as the Ice Climbers, scale 32 vertically scrolling, ice-covered mountains to recover stolen vegetables from a giant condor. In some European countries, Ice Climber was a pack-in game for the NES console.
