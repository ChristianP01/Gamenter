Titolo: Doomdark's Revenge

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Doomdark's Revenge is a role-playing and wargame video game developed by Mike Singleton and published by Beyond Software for the ZX Spectrum in 1984. It is a sequel to Singleton's 1984 seminal The Lords of Midnight and has similar game mechanics but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased.
In Doomdark's Revenge, the hero of the first game, Luxor the Moonprince, goes into the savage wastes of Icemark to rescue his son Morkin and defeat the evil Empress Shareth, daughter of his enemy Doomdark. Despite the title, Doomdark - who was killed in the first game - does not return in the sequel.
Like its predecessor, Doomdark's Revenge was a major critical success and a commercial hit. Ports to the Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 were released in 1986. It was supposed to be followed by a sequel titled The Eye of the Moon in 1989, which was never finished. Another sequel, Lords of Midnight: The Citadel, was eventually released in 1995. A remake of Doomdark's Revenge was released in February 2014.
