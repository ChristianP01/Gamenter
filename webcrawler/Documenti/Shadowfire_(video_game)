Descrizione: Shadowfire is a computer game for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 and later released for the Amstrad CPC. It was developed by British developer Denton Designs and  published by Beyond Software in 1985.  The player must direct the Enigma Force to rescue Ambassador Kryxix from the traitor Zoff's flagship before the timer runs out and secret plans for a new type of starship are discovered. Shadowfire was one of the first games to use a menu-and-icon-driven interface, even with a lightpen. It was well received by reviewers of the time, and followed by a sequel, Enigma Force, in 1986.
