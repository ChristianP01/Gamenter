Descrizione: IncrediBots is a physics simulation game and series produced by Canadian studio Grubby Games and was later purchased by Big Fish Games. It uses the Box2D physics engine, which allows objects created in a simple click and drag fashion to interact realistically. Users can create basic geometric shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles, and then connect them together using different types of joints. The three basic kinds of joints are fixed joints (which permanently connect two shapes together to form a larger solid shape), rotating joints (which allow rotational movement), and sliding joints (which give objects one-dimensional linear movement, much like a pneumatic piston). Once combined with shapes, these joints form what are known as "'bots", "robots", or "IncrediBots". One other kind of joint, thrusters, are like rocket engines.
IncrediBots allows movement in a two-dimensional plane, in which the bottom of the user's screen is the gravitational 'down'. Although this lack of a third dimension can be limiting, it allows for much easier construction and faster processing speeds.
On November 20, 2010, the IncrediBot series' servers were shut down. The games are now available offline. Going to the website will take users to the community forum.
As of March 31, 2011, the forums and official game edits are now hosted on the original domain and are maintained by the current IncrediBots staff.
