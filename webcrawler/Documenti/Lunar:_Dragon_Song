Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Lunar: Dragon Song, known in Japan and Europe as Lunar Genesis (ルナ-ジェネシス-, Runa Jenesisu), is a role-playing video game developed by Japan Art Media for the Nintendo DS handheld console. The game was released in Japan by Marvelous Interactive on August 25, 2005, and later available in North America by Ubisoft on September 27, and a European version on February 17, 2006 by Rising Star Games. As the first original Lunar series title in ten years, it was also the first traditional role-playing game available for the Nintendo DS, utilizing several new features such as combat taking place across of two screens and the use of the system's built-in microphone to issue commands.
The game takes place a thousand years before the events of the first Lunar game, Lunar: The Silver Star, and centers on Jian Campbell, a young delivery boy and adventurer who must save the world from the rising menace of the Vile Tribe, a race of powerful magicians who wish to gain control of the goddess Althena and take over the world. Largely panned by critics, the game has received negative reviews due to a number of gameplay additions often seen as tedious and debilitating, such as the inability to target specific enemies in combat, as well as the decision to not include series mainstays such as voice acting and full-motion video sequences.
