 'Anno: 1996\n'

 'Descrizione: Close Combat is a 1996 real-time computer wargame developed by '
 'Atomic Games and published by Microsoft. Set during World War II, it '
 "simulates the conflict between the United States' 29th Infantry Division and "
 "Germany's 352nd Infantry Division after the Invasion of Normandy. The player "
 'controls an artificially intelligent army whose behavior is dictated by '
 'psychological models: each soldier makes decisions based on the '
 "circumstances of the battlefield and can disobey the player's orders.\n"
 'Close Combat began production at Atomic Games under publisher Three-Sixty '
 'Pacific in 1992. The following year, Atomic migrated with the project to '
 "Avalon Hill, as part of Avalon's attempt to bolster its computer game "
 'business. It was originally announced as Beyond Squad Leader, a tie-in to '
 "Avalon's million-selling Squad Leader board wargame franchise. However, the "
 "companies' relationship was troubled, and Atomic broke away after a "
 'high-profile departure at its publisher. Renaming the project Close Combat, '
 'Atomic continued production with Microsoft and ultimately released the game '
 'in July 1996. Military psychologist Dr. Steven Silver worked with the team '
 "to increase the accuracy of Close Combat's psychological modeling.\n"
 'With sales of 200,000 copies, the game was a commercial success. Critics '
 'offered praise to its visuals, and several commended its innovation. '
 'Conversely, its slow scrolling was often criticized, and some labeled its '
 'use of psychological models as a fundamental mistake. The game started the '
 'Close Combat series, which encompassed 17 titles and sold in excess of 5 '
 'million copies by 2018. Atomic developed four sequels to Close Combat by '
 '2000 and later created Close Combat: Marines for the United States Marine '
 "Corps. Following the company's sale to Destineer, the franchise has "
 'continued at other developers under publisher Matrix Games since 2007.\n'

 'Descrizione: Hamurabi is a text-based strategy video game of land and '
 'resource management. It was first developed under the name King of Sumeria '
 'or The Sumer Game by Doug Dyment in 1968 at Digital Equipment Corporation as '
 "a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL "
 'programming language.\n'
 'The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient '
 'Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops '
 'for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, '
 'while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. The Sumer '
 'Game was inspired by The Sumerian Game, a much more in-depth text-based '
 'economic simulation intended for children, developed from 1964 to 1966 by '
 'designer and elementary school teacher Mabel Addis and IBM programmer '
 'William McKay.\n'
 'Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL language, but '
 'around 1971 David H. Ahl ported it to DEC BASIC and in 1973 published it in '
 '101 BASIC Games. This was later republished in Microsoft BASIC form in '
 "1978's BASIC Computer Games. His expanded version of the game, titled "
 'Hamurabi, quickly became the more prominent version due to the popularity of '
 'both the book and the programming language. Hamurabi influenced many later '
 'strategy and simulation games and is also an antecedent to the city-building '
 'genre.\n'

 'Descrizione: Sweet Home is a survival horror role-playing video game '
 'developed and published by Capcom for the Family Computer in 1989. It is '
 'based on the Japanese horror film of the same name and tells the story of a '
 'team of five filmmakers exploring an old mansion in search of precious '
 'frescos hidden there. As they explore the mysterious mansion, they encounter '
 'hostile ghosts and other supernatural enemies. The player must navigate the '
 'intricately laid out mansion, battling with the enemies, and also a '
 'permadeath system to keep the player characters alive with the limited '
 'weapons and health restorative items available.\n'
 'The game was directed by Tokuro Fujiwara, who previously worked primarily on '
 "arcade games such as Ghosts 'n Goblins (1985). Fujiwara toured the film's "
 "set to gather inspiration for the game, and the film's director gave "
 "Fujiwara permission to take some liberties with the game's script. Sweet "
 'Home was released in December 1989 exclusively in Japan, where it gathered '
 'generally favorable reception and was considered better than the film. The '
 "game was never localized to western markets, likely because of the game's "
 'gruesome imagery and the unpopularity of role-playing games outside Japan.\n'
 'In retrospect, Sweet Home is considered a landmark game and is often cited '
 'for laying the groundwork for the survival horror genre. It served as the '
 'main inspiration behind Resident Evil (1996) which was a massive critical '
 'and commercial success, launching a multimedia franchise. Later games in the '
 'series continue to pull inspiration from the game through the use of quick '
 'time events, inventory management systems, and ghost story elements. Sweet '
 "Home's Metroidvania-style exploration, storytelling methods, and horror "
 'elements have been cited as precursors to key elements found in other '
 'successful games decades later.\n'

 'The game was developed at Bell Labs before the rise of the commercial video '

 '1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the '
 'GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 computer. As a part of porting the '
 'game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed his own operating system, which later '
 'formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread '

 'Anno: 1989\n'
 '\n'
 'Descrizione: Mother, officially known outside of Japan as EarthBound '
 'Beginnings, is a 1989 role-playing video game developed by Ape and published '
 'by Nintendo for the Famicom. It is the first entry in the Mother series. It '
 'is modeled on the gameplay of the Dragon Quest series, but is set in the '
 'late 20th-century United States, unlike its fantasy genre contemporaries. '
 "Mother follows the young Ninten as he uses his great-grandfather's studies "
 'on psychic powers to fight hostile, formerly inanimate objects and other '
 'enemies. The game uses random encounters to enter a menu-based, first-person '
 'perspective battle system.\n'
 "Writer and director Shigesato Itoi pitched Mother's concept to Shigeru "
 "Miyamoto while visiting Nintendo's headquarters for other business. Though "
 'Miyamoto rejected the proposal at first, he eventually gave Itoi a '
 'development team. A North American version of the game was localized into '
 'English, but was abandoned as commercially nonviable. A copy of this '
 'prototype was later found and circulated on the Internet under the informal '
 'title EarthBound Zero. The game was eventually released worldwide under the '
 'name EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2015.\n'
 'Mother was the sixth best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, where it sold about '
 '400,000 copies and received a "Silver Hall of Fame" score from Famitsu '
 'magazine. Mother was praised for its similarities to the Dragon Quest series '
 "and its simultaneous parody of the genre's tropes; however, many considered "
 'its sequel EarthBound to be similar and a better overall implementation of '
 "Mother's gameplay ideas, with the game's high difficulty level polarizing "
 'critics, along with balance issues. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com wrote that '
 'Mother importantly generated interest in video game emulation and the '
 'historical preservation of unreleased games. The game was re-released in '
 'Japan on the single-cartridge compilation Mother 1+2 for the Game Boy '
 'Advance in 2003.\n'
