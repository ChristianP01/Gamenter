The player uses a number of acrobatic skills, such as double jumping and wall jumping to progress through the game's fifty-some levels, cleaning sections covered by leaves and attacking filth-covered creatures to score and progress through the level.  The player's performance is ranked based on time and completion, and access to certain levels requires near-perfect runs of earlier levels.
