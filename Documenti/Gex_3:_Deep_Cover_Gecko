Titolo: Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko  is a 1999 platform video game and the third installment of the Gex video game series, which released in 1999 and 2000 for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Color. Its protagonist, Gex, is a wisecracking, pop culture enthusiast voiced by Danny John-Jules in the UK and European release and comedian Dana Gould, reprising his role from former Gex games, for the American release. Gameplay is set in Gex's secret hideout, the Mission Control overworld, which is overseen by Gex's butler, Alfred the Turtle. Playboy model Marliece Andrada plays Gex's kidnapped companion, Agent Xtra, the only live-action character, who is featured in brief full-motion video sequences on the Nintendo 64 version. The plot follows Gex's return to the Media Dimension to rescue Agent Xtra from Rez, Gex's arch-nemesis from the previous games.
Developer Crystal Dynamics conceived Gex 3 as a sequel to 1998's Gex: Enter the Gecko and incorporated unused elements of the game's design into Gex 3. Advancements in the utilization of available technology allowed Gex 3 to feature a set of bigger levels, more on-screen characters, different textures, and an retooled camera system over its predecessors that maximizes gameplay improvements with consideration to the hardware limitations of the time. Certain aspects from the original Gex were brought back as well, such as the addition of secret levels and bug collectibles.
Gex 3 was met with mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, with a fair amount of criticism directed at the differences between the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation versions.
