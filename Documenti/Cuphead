Titolo: Cuphead

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Cuphead (also known as Cuphead: "Don't Deal with the Devil") is a 2017 run-and-gun video game developed and published by Studio MDHR. It was inspired by the rubber hose style from the golden age of American animation, and the subversive and surrealist qualities of works of Walt Disney Animation Studios and Fleischer Studios.
It features one or two players controlling protagonist Cuphead and his brother Mugman to fight through several levels that culminate in boss fights, in order to repay their debt to the Devil. The game was praised for its art style, gameplay, soundtrack, and difficulty. It was a critical and commercial success, winning several awards with more than six million copies sold within three years. An expansion titled The Delicious Last Course is scheduled for release on June 30, 2022. A Netflix animated series, The Cuphead Show!, is scheduled for release on February 18, 2022.
