It could be expanded with additional downloadable content (DLC) from the integrated Games For Windows Marketplace on Xbox-Live .Microsoft closed the Xbox.com PC Marketplace on August 22, 2013. Previous items purchased are still usable, and the Flight software may still be downloadable, but no items can be acquired through the marketplace.
