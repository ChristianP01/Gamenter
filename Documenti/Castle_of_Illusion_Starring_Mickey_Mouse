Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse is a 1990 platform game developed by Sega and released for the Mega Drive/Genesis. An 8-bit version of the game was later released for the Master System and Game Gear. The game follows Mickey Mouse on a quest to save Minnie Mouse from the evil witch Mizrabel. It was the first game in Sega's long-running Illusion video game series starring Mickey and was also a part of the second wave of games initially released for the Mega Drive/Genesis which helped seal the console's reputation within the period until the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991.
Castle of Illusion was very well received by critics, especially the original 16-bit version. It was re-released in 1998 in Japan as part of the Sega Ages: Mickey Mouse & Donald Duck for the Sega Saturn, which features both Castle of Illusion and QuackShot. A remake of the game by Sega Studios Australia was released for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC in September 2013. The game was also included on the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019.
