Titolo: Super Pitfall

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Super Pitfall (スーパーピットフォール, Sūpā Pittofōru) is a 1986 side-scrolling platform video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, NEC PC-8801, and TRS-80 Color Computer 3 published under Activision's license. Despite the title screen stating that it was developed by Pony Inc, the actual development of the NES version was handled by Micronics, with the PC-8801 version being developed by Pony Inc. while the CoCo version is credited as being "Programmed by Steve Bjork of SRB Software". The PC-8801 version released in November 1986, two months after the original release in September 1986, although this variant of the game was limited to single-screen platforming rather than side-scrolling.
In addition to being a new entry in Activision's Pitfall! series for the Atari 2600, Super Pitfall was the first game that Activision published as a third-party developer. A sequel titled Super Pitfall II — the localized version of Sunsoft's Famicom title, Atlantis no Nazo – was planned, but was cancelled a short time later.
