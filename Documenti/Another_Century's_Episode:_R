Titolo: Another Century's Episode: R

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Another Century's Episode: R is a 2010 third-person shooter video game published by Namco Bandai Games in Japan for the PlayStation 3. It is the fourth entry in the Another Century's Episode series, following Another Century's Episode 3: The Final (2007). The player controls a mech from one of thirteen different anime robot franchises through a series of missions, ranging from destroying enemy machines to protecting a specific target.
The development of R was handled by FromSoftware, a Japanese developer known for the Armored Core and Dark Souls franchises. Series publisher Banpresto had been reorganized into a toy company prior to its release and no longer released video games, though it was given control over the project's direction. Banpresto enlisted the help of the Super Robot Wars development team to work on the game, and incorporated music by the progressive rock group Acid Black Cherry.
Though it was a commercial success and is the best-selling entry in the Another Century's Episode series, R received largely mediocre reviews, having been described as "a functional mess". Critics disliked its overhaul to the gameplay, which they believed made it inferior to previous installments, as well as the controls for being imprecise and unresponsive at times. It was followed by Another Century's Episode Portable in 2011.
