Titolo: Just Dance (video game)

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Just Dance is a rhythm game developed by Ubisoft Milan and Ubisoft Paris and published by Ubisoft as the first main installment of the series. The game was released exclusively for the Wii on November 17, 2009 in North America, November 26, 2009 in Australia, and November 27, 2009 in Europe.
Expanding upon a concept introduced in a minigame for Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party, players mimic the motions of an on-screen dancer's choreography for a selected song, using the Wii Remote to judge the player's motions and accuracy (eschewing accessories such as physical dance pads).
Just Dance was released to mixed-to-negative reviews. It was criticized for its simplistic gameplay, poor motion detection, and a lack of progression or additional content beyond what was included on-disc. At the same time, the simplistic gameplay of Just Dance was praised for being accessible to a casual audience, its "fun" soundtrack and dance routines, and for becoming more enjoyable as a multiplayer party game. Just Dance was a major commercial success, selling over 4.3 million copies worldwide and establishing a franchise that, as of October 2013, had collectively sold over 40 million units, making it Ubisoft's second-largest franchise.
