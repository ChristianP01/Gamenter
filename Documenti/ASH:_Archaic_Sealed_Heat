Titolo: ASH: Archaic Sealed Heat

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: ASH: Archaic Sealed Heat is a 2007 tactical role-playing game co-developed by Mistwalker and Racjin, and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS exclusively in Japan. The storyline follows Aisya, princess of Millinear, after her kingdom is burned to ashes by a fire monster on her coronation day. Given the ability to revive the dead as ash-formed bodies, she sets out to investigate the causes behind the disaster. The gameplay combines tactical grid-based movement of 2D characters in a field environment, and traditional turn-based battles when two party units engage represented by CGI models.
The game was created by Mistwalker founder Hironobu Sakaguchi, who acted as executive producer, writer and designer. Production lasted roughly two years, with Sakaguchi using his love for the genre when creating the design concept. Among the first projects conceived and announced for Mistwalker, Sakaguchi collaborated on the project with artist Hideo Minaba and composers Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata, who had worked with Sakaguchi during their time at Square. Due to its heavy use of CGI graphics, it was the first DS title to ship on a two-gigabit cartridge. Debuting to low sales in Japan, the title saw mixed opinions from critics. Praise went to its narrative and gameplay, but its graphics and pacing saw mixed responses.
