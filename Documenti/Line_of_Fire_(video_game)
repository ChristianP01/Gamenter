Titolo: Line of Fire (video game)

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Line of Fire is a first-person light gun shooter game developed by Sega and released for arcades in 1989. It was released with two arcade cabinet versions, a standard upright and a sit-down cockpit, both featuring two positional guns. The cockpit design allows the player(s) to sit down while playing the game, while having two-handed machine guns, controlled by a potentiometer-controlled gun alignment software system. The game follows a two-man commando unit as they try to escape from a terrorist facility after seizing a prototype weapon.
The arcade game was praised by critics for its pseudo-3D graphics and cockpit cabinet, but with the gameplay criticized for being derivative of Operation Wolf (1987) and Operation Thunderbolt (1988). It was converted for home computers and published by U.S. Gold in 1990, and then released for the Master System in 1991; however, the style of the latter was changed to that of an overhead scrolling run-and-gun shooter. The home computer versions were criticized for "blocky" visuals, though reviewers found that there were some nice touches, while the Sega Master System version also received mixed reviews.
