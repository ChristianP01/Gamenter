Titolo: Crazy Arcade

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Crazy Arcade (Korean: 크레이지 아케이드) is a free Korean online multiplayer game developed by Nexon.  It has offered up to five different game modes throughout its history: Bomb and Bubbles (BnB), Tetris, Hidden Catch, Dizzy Pang, and Bz.  However, the latter four were eventually removed from the game.  BnB, which takes on the classic Bomberman series, adds its own twist to the game by replacing Bomberman's bombs with water balloons. Crazy Arcade's success spawned a franchise, having been followed by the release of the games CrazyRacing KartRider, CrazyShooting BubbleFighter, and CrazyRacing AirRider.
Nexon announced that they will be bringing Crazy Arcade, as well as Dragon Nest and Mabinogi Heroes to America in 2010 under their new game portal, Block Party. On December 7, 2009, Nexon America launched the official website for PopTag!, which is the North American name of Crazy Arcade. Nexon has decided to forgo the closed beta testing phase and jump right into an open beta. The open beta of PopTag! began on January 26 and ended a month later. PopTag! was closed by publishers Nexon America on July 14, 2011 due to "multiple factors including the [in]ability to deliver new content regularly due to the limited resources [...] available for the game".
