Descrizione: Mega Man 5  is an action-platform video game developed by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the fifth game in the original Mega Man series and was released in Japan on December 4, 1992. It saw a release during the same month in North America and in 1993 in Europe.
Taking place after the events of Mega Man 4, Mega Man's brother and ally Proto Man leads a group of menacing robots in attacks on the world and kidnaps his creator Dr. Light, forcing Mega Man to fight against his brother. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, a robotic bird that the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectible letters are found. Artist Keiji Inafune had to re-illustrate the bosses several times but described his work as fun.
Mega Man 5 was met with a positive critical reception for its graphics, difficulty, and music, while receiving criticism for its lack of innovation in its plot or gameplay. Like previous games in the series, Mega Man 5 was remade for PlayStation in Japan. It later appeared on mobile phones, and become part of game collections, including Mega Man Anniversary Collection. It has also been released through Virtual Console and PlayStation Network in emulated form. Two follow-ups were developed at the same time and released in 1993: Mega Man 6, a direct sequel for NES, and Mega Man X, a spin-off for Super Nintendo, and start of its own game series.
