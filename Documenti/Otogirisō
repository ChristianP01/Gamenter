Titolo: Otogirisō

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Otogirisō (弟切草, lit. St John's wort) is a visual novel produced and originally published by Chunsoft. Marketed by Chunsoft as a "sound novel" rather than a video game, it is the progenitor of the developer and publisher's sound novel series and of the format of electronic entertainment now usually known generically as a visual novel. Koichi Nakamura conceived the title after showing his work on the Dragon Quest role-playing video games to a girl he was dating. On finding she did not enjoy them, he was encouraged to make a video game that he described as "for people who haven't played games before." Influenced by the early survival horror game Sweet Home, he developed it into a horror-themed interactive story. The game sold over 400,000 copies in Japan, including over 300,000 copies for Super Famicom and 100,000 for PlayStation. It was later adapted into the film St. John's Wort. A sequel,  Kirigirisō, was released in 2016, produced by Spike Chunsoft and serving as a crossover with and prequel to the Danganronpa series.
