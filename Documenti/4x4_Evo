Titolo: 4x4 Evo

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: 4x4 Evo (also re-released as 4x4 Evolution) is a video game developed by Terminal Reality for the Windows, Macintosh, SEGA Dreamcast, and PlayStation 2 platforms. It is one of the first console games to have cross-platform online play where Dreamcast, Macintosh, and Windows versions of the game appear online at the same time. The game can use maps created by users to download onto a hard drive as well as a Dreamcast VMU. All versions of the game are similar in quality and gameplay although the online systems feature a mode to customize the players' own truck and use it online. The game is still online-capable on all systems except for PlayStation 2. This was Terminal Reality's only video game to be released for the SEGA Dreamcast.
