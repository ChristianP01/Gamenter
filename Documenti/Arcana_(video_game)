Titolo: Arcana (video game)

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Arcana is a 1992 role-playing video game for the SNES by HAL Laboratory. The game represents all of its characters as cards, but plays like a dungeon-crawling role-playing game rather than a card-based game. In keeping with this metaphor, the death of a character results in a 'torn' card, and the magical properties of some cards are used to explain abilities of the game's characters.

Genere: Dungeon crawl
