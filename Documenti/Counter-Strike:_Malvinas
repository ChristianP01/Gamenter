Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Counter-Strike: Malvinas is a multiplayer first-person shooter modification of Counter-Strike: Source, developed and distributed by Argentinian web hosting company Dattatec. The mod was released worldwide on 4 March 2013 and utilizes the Source game engine. The game is set in Stanley, the capital of the Falkland Islands, and revolves around a group of Argentine special forces capturing the archipelago from British "terrorists". The objective of the game is similar to that of the Counter-Strike series; each round is won by either detonating a bomb or by eliminating all members of the enemy team. Counter-Strike: Malvinas pays homage to the 1982 Falklands War, in which an estimated 650 Argentine and 255 British servicemen died.
The mod prompted strong controversy in the United Kingdom; Dattatec's website was targeted by British hackers on 27 March 2013.
