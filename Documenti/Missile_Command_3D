Descrizione: Missile Command 3D is a shoot 'em up video game developed by Virtuality Entertainment and published by Atari Corporation exclusively for the Atari Jaguar in North America on December 12, 1995, and Europe on December 15 of the same year. Part of Atari Corp.'s 2000 series, it is an update to Dave Theurer's 1980 arcade game Missile Command and the only officially released title that features support for the unreleased Jaguar VR peripheral.Following the same premise as with the original arcade game, the player must defend six cities in their zone from being destroyed as a regional commander of three anti-missile batteries by attacking an endless hail of ballistic missiles, some of which split like multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, with new weapons being introduced in later levels.
Missile Command 3D received mixed to positive reception since its release but it has been recently referred by publications like PC Magazine as one of the best titles for the system. A port for the PC was planned to be published by Atari Interactive, but it was never released.
