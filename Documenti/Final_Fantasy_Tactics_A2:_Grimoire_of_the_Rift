Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. Releasing in 2007 in Japan and 2008 in the West, the game is a sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and forms part of the Ivalice Alliance, a group of games set in the titular fictional universe. The game features cameo appearances from central and supporting characters from Final Fantasy XII, a title set in Ivalice.
Tactics A2 follows a young man named Luso Clemens after he is transported through a magical book to the world of Ivalice. Rescued from monsters by a clan leader named Cid and later joined by the thief Adelle, Luso becomes involved in battles between rival clans as he seeks a way home. Gameplay carries over mechanics from Tactics Advance including turn-based combat on a grid, a themed Job system, and a "Law" system placing limitations on player action during battles.
Originally planned for Game Boy Advance prior to the DS's worldwide commercial success, the project began development in 2006 with the aim of expanding on the elements of Tactics Advance. Director Yuichi Murasawa, artist Ryoma Ito, and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto all returned from Tactics Advance. The English translation was done by Alexander O. Smith and Joseph Reeder, who had worked on Final Fantasy XII and Vagrant Story. It received generally positive reviews, and went on to sell 670,000 units worldwide. Elements from the game were later used in mobile titles set in Ivalice.
