Titolo: Black (video game)

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Black is a first-person shooter video game developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in February 2006, and was later ported to the Xbox 360 via backwards compatibility in 2008. The player assumes control of Jack Kellar, a black ops agent being interrogated about his previous missions involving a terrorist operation. Played from a first-person perspective, players confront enemies using firearms and grenades. The game is notable for its heavily stylized cinema-inspired action as well as its sound quality and focus on destructive effects during gameplay.
Black received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics praised the gameplay, sound design and presentation, but criticized the game's short length and lack of multiplayer. Despite Criterion's desire to develop a sequel, creative differences with Electronic Arts ultimately ended plans for one. As such a spiritual successor, Bodycount, was created by the same developers at Codemasters and released in 2011.
