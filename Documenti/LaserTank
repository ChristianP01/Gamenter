Titolo: LaserTank

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: LaserTank (also known as Laser Tank) is a computer puzzle game requiring logical thinking to solve a variety of levels. It is open source, careware, and can be used for free. The player must be able to concentrate and think ahead as in playing chess or checkers. Contradicting its name, LaserTank is in no way an action game. Although a player may try to solve a level quickly, there is no requirement to do so, so poor coordination and poor reflexes will not impede a player. Experience allows the player to learn a number of techniques and tricks that need to be used to solve difficult levels.
LaserTank is NP-complete
meaning that one can construct levels which are hard to solve for even computers.
