Titolo: Devil's Crush

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Devil's Crush is a pinball video game developed by Compile for the TurboGrafx-16 and released in 1990. The second installment in the Crush Pinball series after Alien Crush, the game has an eerie occult theme with skulls, skeletons, and demons. It was later followed by Jaki Crush and Alien Crush Returns.
The game was ported to the Sega Genesis, retitled Dragon's Fury (Devil Crash MD in Japan) by developer Technosoft. Both North American versions, TurboGrafx-16 and Genesis, are censored â€” all hexagrams have been changed to generic stars, and coffins with crucifixes on them in one bonus stage have been changed to vases. Devil's Crush was later released on the Wii's Virtual Console, with the European release reverting to its original title; however, the pentagram symbols were removed and replaced with an 8-sided star. It also saw release on the Wii U eShop in 2017.
