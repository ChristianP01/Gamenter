Descrizione: NCAA Basketball, known in Europe as World League Basketball, is a basketball video game which was developed by Sculptured Software for the Super NES.
It was the first basketball game for a console to utilize a 3D perspective. The game uses the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 to create a 3D players' perspective that became the standard for later basketball video games. Sculptured's NHL Stanley Cup featured a similar effect.
