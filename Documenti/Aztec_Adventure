In the game, the player takes the control of Niño, an adventurer who must traverse a maze in search for treasures. While the original Japanese version depicts the adventure in Nazca, the story and title were later changed to be based in Aztec settings for international releases, though the elements of the former culture, including the Nazca Lines, can still be seen.
