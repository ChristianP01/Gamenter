Descrizione: Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story is a fighting video game developed and originally published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment in Europe for the Sega Genesis in June 1994. It is based on the 1993 film of the same name, which is a semi-fictionalized account of the life of Hong Kong-American actor and martial artist Bruce Lee. Following the events of the movie, players take control of Bruce Lee across several stages that takes places in different time periods of his life and fight against some of his adversaries.
Initially released for Sega platforms, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story was later ported to the Atari Jaguar and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, each one featuring several changes and additions compared with the original version while both the Game Gear and Master System versions, which were also released in 1994, feature an entirely different gameplay format.
Since its release, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story garnered mixed reception from critics across North American and European regions between each version. The original Sega Genesis release received mixed to positive reception from reviewers who praised the graphics and audio but criticized the slow-paced and unoriginal gameplay. Both the Game Gear and Master System versions were met with an equally mixed reception, receiving praise for the visuals but criticized for the repetitive and slow gameplay. The Jaguar port was also met with a mixed but slightly more positive response from reviewers who were divided in regards to the visuals and audio, with some feeling that it did not improved upon from the 16-bit versions, while the Super Nintendo conversion got mixed reception as well. A conversion for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was planned but never released.
