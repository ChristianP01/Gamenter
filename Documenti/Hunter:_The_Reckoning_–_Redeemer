Titolo: Hunter: The Reckoning – Redeemer

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Hunter: The Reckoning – Redeemer is a 2003 hack-and-slash video game developed by High Voltage Software and published by Vivendi Universal Games for the Xbox. It is based on the tabletop role-playing game Hunter: The Reckoning, and is part of the larger World of Darkness series. It is the third Hunter video game, following Hunter: The Reckoning (2002) and Wayward (2003).
Players take the roles of hunters, who fight undead hordes using ranged weapons, melee weapons, and magic. The story is set ten years after the first Hunter: The Reckoning video game, and sees the original's four hunters team up with the new hunter Kaylie to investigate incidents in the town of Ashcroft connected to the Genefex Corporation and werewolves.
The planning of the game began in the middle of the development of the first Hunter: The Reckoning video game, and was heavily influenced by player feedback. Redeemer performed moderately well commercially, and saw a mixed critical response, with critics praising the game's multiplayer mode and visuals, and enjoying the story and addition of Kaylie, but criticizing the level design as confusing.
