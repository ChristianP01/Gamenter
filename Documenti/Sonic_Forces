Titolo: Sonic Forces

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Sonic Forces is a 2017 platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. Produced in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, it was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in November 2017. The story sees Sonic the Hedgehog joining a resistance force to stop Doctor Eggman, who has conquered the world alongside new villain Infinite. It features three gameplay modes: "Classic", side-scrolling gameplay similar to the original Sega Genesis Sonic games; "Modern", 3D gameplay similar to Sonic Unleashed (2008) and Sonic Colors (2010); and a mode featuring the "Avatar", the player's custom character.
The game was primarily developed by staff who had worked on Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations, using an updated version of the Hedgehog Engine, used in Sonic Unleashed and Generations. Development began after the release of Sonic Lost World in 2013. The game was intended to have a darker tone compared to previous entries in the franchise, and the character creation system was inspired by Sonic fan art the developers had come across over the years. It was announced, alongside Sonic Mania, under the working title of Project Sonic 2017 during the Sonic 25th anniversary event at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con.
Sonic Forces received mixed reviews from critics. They praised its presentation, music, voice acting, character creation system, and the Modern Sonic gameplay, but criticized the plot, overly scripted level design and gameplay, technical problems and the inclusion of Classic Sonic. Many critics called it a disappointment in the wake of the positively received Sonic Mania, released earlier that year.
