Titolo: Love & Destroy

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Love & Destroy is a third-person shooter video game with dating sim elements co-developed by Arc Entertainment and Inti Creates. It was released by Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. (SCEI) for the PlayStation exclusively in Japan in 1999. Set in the near future, the plot depicts an alien invasion which nearly brings about human extinction. To save humanity, a scientist sends three remaining mechs and their robotic, female navigators back in time where they recruit the unnamed, male protagonist as a mech pilot to stamp out the invasion. Bringing out the full, offensive potential of a mech requires a positive, emotional link between the human pilot and navigator.
Part of the gameplay in Love & Destroy is made up of 3D shooter missions, where the player battles enemies after choosing one of three navigators and her respective mech, each equipped with a unique set of weapons. These action segments alternate with romantic interactions between the player character and the navigators. The story unfolds differently depending on the player's use of navigator, on-screen choices, and performance during missions.
Staff members for SCEI subsidiary Arc Entertainment were previously known for their work on the Arc the Lad series of role-playing games, while Love & Destroy marked new developer Inti Creates' second overall release. Love & Destroy features character designs by manga artist Masakazu Katsura and animated cutscenes by the studio Production I.G. The game sold poorly and critical reception has been mixed.
