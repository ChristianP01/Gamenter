Titolo: Oninaki

Anno: 2019

Descrizione: Oninaki is a 2019 action role-playing game developed by Tokyo RPG Factory and published worldwide by parent company Square Enix for PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch. Gameplay has players exploring dungeon areas selected from a world map, fighting enemies in real-time combat with spirit weapons called Daemons while shifting between the world of the living and an afterlife referred to as the "Beyond". Oninaki is set in a world where the doctrine of reincarnation is enforced by figures called Watchers, who assist in the passing of souls and fight monsters born of regret. The player controls the Watcher Kagachi as he confronts a shrouded figure called the Night Devil. As his journey continues, Kagachi uncovers hidden truths surrounding the cycle of reincarnation and his own past life.
Concept work began in 2016 during the last stages of Lost Sphear's development. Takashi Tokita, noted for his work on Chrono Trigger, came on board as a creative producer and pushed writer Hirotaka Inaba's story in a darker direction than his earlier work. The gameplay and graphics were also changed, becoming more action-focused and cinematic. The music was composed by Shunsuke Tsuchiya and Mariam Abounnasr of Procyon Studio. The game has received mixed reviews from critics upon release, with praise going to its mature setting and art design, though several criticised its story delivery and gameplay.
