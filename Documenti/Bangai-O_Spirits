Descrizione: Bangai-O Spirits is an action game for the Nintendo DS, and the sequel to Bangai-O which was released on the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast.
Bangai-O Spirits is a side-scrolling shooting game with free-scrolling levels that extend horizontally and vertically. The player controls a robot with the ability to fly, but is still affected by gravity. He has seven weapons to choose from, and can perform melee attacks using a baseball bat or sword.
The game has 160 levels, and features a level editor to create more. Edited levels can be encoded in a sound that can be recorded with a computer and shared between players. This technology was inspired by the datacasettes used by some older computers, including the Sharp X1 on which Matsumoto learned to program.
