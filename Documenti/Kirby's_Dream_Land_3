Descrizione: Kirby's Dream Land 3 is a platform game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Starring Kirby, it is the fifth installment in the Kirby series and the third game under the Kirby's Dream Land name. Although the first game was largely unrelated, Dream Land 3 features many similar characters to Dream Land 2. Dream Land 3 was followed by Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards in 2000.
Kirby's Dream Land 3 was the last SNES game published by Nintendo in North America. Problems with the game's PAL conversion prevented it from being released in Europe and Australia for many years; it was eventually released for the Virtual Console in those regions in the form of an import from North America on July 24, 2009, for the Wii and on July 25, 2013, for the Wii U. The game was re-released on the Virtual Console in North America on January 5, 2009, for the Wii and on May 8, 2013, for the Wii U and in Japan on April 28, 2009, for the Wii and on May 8, 2013, for the Wii U. It was also included as part of the 2012 Wii compilation Kirby's Dream Collection and the Nintendo Switch Online SNES game service.
