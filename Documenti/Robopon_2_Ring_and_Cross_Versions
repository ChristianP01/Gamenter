Titolo: Robopon 2 Ring and Cross Versions

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Robopon 2 Ring Version and Robopon 2 Cross Version are video games published by Atlus and released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001–2002. They are sequels to the Game Boy Color game Robopon. Their simultaneous release is similar to how the Pokémon series of video games are released in pairs of games (such as Pokémon Red and Blue) to promote inter-connectivity between them.
The games are a sequel to the earlier 2000 Game Boy Color game Robopon Sun. The Robopon bears much similarity to Nintendo's series of Pokémon games, and thus is often considered to be a Pokémon clone, but also bears similarity to the lesser known Super Nintendo Entertainment System game Robotrek, released by the Japanese game company Enix (now Square Enix).
