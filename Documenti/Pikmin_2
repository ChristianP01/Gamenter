Descrizione: Pikmin 2 (ピクミン2, Pikumin Tsū) is a 2004 puzzle strategy video game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube home video game console. It is the direct sequel to the 2001 game Pikmin and is the second game in the Pikmin series.
Like its predecessor, Pikmin 2 focuses on exploring the surface of an unknown planet from a microscopic perspective, where the player directs and delegates tasks to a horde of tiny plant-like creatures called Pikmin. The Pikmin can be directed to destroy obstacles, defeat enemies and retrieve objects. It introduces many gameplay mechanics not seen in Pikmin, including the ability to control two different leaders of the Pikmin at once and the addition of new Pikmin types.
The game received critical acclaim, gaining aggregate scores of 89.60% and 90 on GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Many critics praised the additions to the Pikmin gameplay, such as the removal of the 30-day time limit imposed in the original game. Pikmin and Pikmin 2 were re-released as part of the New Play Control! series for the Wii in 2008 and 2009, respectively. On March 30, 2017, the Wii version of Pikmin 2 was digitally re-released worldwide for the Wii U. The sequel to the game, Pikmin 3, was released in 2013 for the Wii U.
