Descrizione: Crusader Kings II: Sons of Abraham is a downloadable content pack developed by Paradox Development Studio and published by Paradox Interactive for the grand strategy wargame Crusader Kings II. The expansion pack created more events and interactions with the Christian, Islamic and Jewish religions within the game. There were concerns by the production staff that elements included such as the ability to expel Jews from the player-held lands and the ability to create the Kingdom of Israel could lead to criticism. Game critics were mostly positive of the game, with praise directed at the new gameplay elements introduced.
