Titolo: Mad Maestro!

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Mad Maestro!, known in Japan as Bravo Music (ブラボーミュージック, Burabō Myūjikku), is a classical music rhythm game for the PlayStation 2 (PS2). It was developed by Desert Productions and released in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEI) and abroad by Eidos Interactive under their "Fresh Games" label on October 11, 2001 in Japan, then later in March 2002 for North America and Europe. Playing as the orchestra conductor Takt, the player must play the song by pressing the button according to the correct pressure on the screen. The game utilizes a soundtrack composed of entirely classical music by famous composers such as Beethoven, Brahms, and Tchaikovsky. The game's original title was Shake It Bravoes! (シェイク イット ブラボーズ!, Sheiku itto burabōzu!).Despite mixed critical reception in the west, the game was sold well and received positive reviews in its native Japan. This led to three Japan-only follow-ups with two "expansions", Bravo Music: Christmas Edition in 2001, and Bravo Music: Chou-Meikyokuban in 2002, and alongside them, a proper sequel called Let's Bravo Music also in 2002.
