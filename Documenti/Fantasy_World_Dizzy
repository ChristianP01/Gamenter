Titolo: Fantasy World Dizzy

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Fantasy World Dizzy is an arcade adventure video game released in October 1989 by Codemasters and designed by the Oliver Twins. 
The game is considered the third in the Dizzy series and was developed under the name Dizzy III. The third Dizzy game to be released, Fast Food, was regarded as a spin-off that deviated from the standard Dizzy format.
Fantasy World Dizzy was the first Dizzy adventure to feature many elements which later became standard for the series, such as having three lives, an improved inventory system and a balance between puzzle-solving and hazards. This game also introduced the Yolkfolk: Daisy, Denzil, Dozy, Dylan and Grand-Dizzy.
A Nintendo Entertainment System version titled Mystery World Dizzy was developed in April 1993 but was not released until 24 years later in April 2017. It's available free on the official Dizzy website. A Kickstarter campaign has also been started to produce the game on a physical NES cartridge.In recent years it has grown more famous due to frequent references made to it in the Zero Punctuation video game review series as "the best game ever", albeit ironically.
