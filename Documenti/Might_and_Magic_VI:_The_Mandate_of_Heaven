Descrizione: Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven, commonly abbreviated to Might and Magic VI or simply  MM6, is a role-playing video game developed by New World Computing and published by 3DO in 1998. It is the sixth installment in the Might and Magic series, the sequel to Might and Magic V: Darkside of Xeen and the first of the Might and Magic titles to take place in the same world as Heroes of Might and Magic. It continues the storyline of Heroes of Might and Magic II, and takes place at the same time as Heroes of Might and Magic III in the series chronology.
A critical success upon release, the game was compared favorably with its peers role-playing video games such as The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall and Ultima. It was universally praised for its non-linear, user-friendly premise, an interactive, detailed game world and a polished,  bug-free initial release. Modern retrospectives credit its tagline of "Witness the rebirth of a legend" as an appropriate harbinger of the renaissance of western RPGs, and credit Might and Magic VI as an important part of that revival.A Limited Edition version of the game was also released, including a cloth map of Enroth, a strategy guide and the first five games of the series on CD-ROM. It was followed by three sequels, with Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor directly continuing the story arc.
