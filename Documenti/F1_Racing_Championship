Titolo: F1 Racing Championship

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: F1 Racing Championship is a video game developed by Ubi Soft. Starring people and locations from the 1999 Formula One World Championship, it was released for several platforms during 2000 and 2001. At the time, it was facing steep competition by the ever-popular Grand Prix 3 and the rising F1-series by ISI. The sales were behind expectations. Reasons were a poor artificial intelligence and damage model and the bug-prone initial release. A patch to fix the reported issues was announced, but never released.
The soundtrack featured "Girl Don't Come" by American/British band Garbage; the main audio sounds in the menu were replicated in Racing Simulation 3, brought out a couple of years later, which again did not sell well due to licensing issues.
