Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Monster Hunter Generations is an action role-playing game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo 3DS. Announced in May 2015, the game was released in Japan as Monster Hunter X in November 2015 and internationally in July 2016. Like other titles in the Monster Hunter series, players undertake quests that involve hunting large dangerous creatures, either solo or in multiplayer. Major additions in this installment include special attacks, new combat styles, and the ability to play as Felynes who have traditionally only appeared as a companion to the player. Although it retains the core gameplay of previous mainline entries, Monster Hunter Generations is considered a spinoff title according to the developers. An expanded version of the game, titled Monster Hunter XX, was announced in October 2016, and was released exclusively in Japan in March 2017. An HD port of the expanded rerelease for the Nintendo Switch, titled Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, was released in Japan in August 2017 followed by a worldwide release in August 2018. The game has sold more than 8 million units worldwide, as of September 2020.
