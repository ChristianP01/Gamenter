Titolo: Echo Night: Beyond

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Echo Night: Beyond, known in Japan as Nebula: Echo Night (ネビュラ -エコーナイト-, Nebyura Ekō Naito) is a 2004 adventure video game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 2 console. Agetec published the game in North America, with the European release, by Indie Games, following in August 2005. It is the third game in the Echo Night series, but has an independent story unrelated to either Echo Night or Echo Night 2: The Lord of Nightmares as the first two games do not share continuity with each other.
The game tells a science fiction ghost story, set in the not-too-distant future. Players take on the role of a newlywed, off for a honeymoon on the Moon. The vessel crashes before reaching its lunar resort destination, however, separating the just-married couple and leaving the hero alone at an abandoned research base. Players explore the station from a first-person perspective, inside a spacesuit. In addition to the many spiritual anomalies that haunt the station, strange lunar lights and relative weightlessness add to the atmosphere of the game's environments.
