Titolo: Deathgarden

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Deathgarden was an asymmetrical multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Behavior Interactive with gameplay similar to another of the studio's games, Dead by Daylight. It was initially launched on Steam Early Access in Summer 2018, and was later relaunched as Deathgarden: Bloodharvest in 2019. However, the same year, it ceased development and went free-to-play after failing to maintain a sufficient playerbase. The game pitted a single invincible Hunter against five Scavengers (previously called Runners) who had to try and escape. While praised by critics for its central concept and lore, it was also criticized for unbalanced gameplay caused by its asymmetrical design. On 12 August 2020, the game's servers closed.
