Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is a hack-and-slash video game developed by Omega Force. It was published by Koei Tecmo in Japan and by Nintendo internationally for the Nintendo Switch console in 2020. In the story, set 100 years before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Link and Princess Zelda must gather allies across Hyrule to fend off forces led by the evil Calamity Ganon, who is attempting to revive himself and destroy the kingdom.
Like the original Hyrule Warriors (2014), Age of Calamity is a crossover mixing the world and characters of Nintendo's Legend of Zelda series with the gameplay of Koei Tecmo's Dynasty Warriors series. Upon release, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity received positive reviews for its gameplay, varied character playstyles, amount of content, visuals, soundtrack, characterization, and expansion of the Breath of the Wild setting. However, some criticized the technical performance, chiefly its inconsistent frame rate, and the story drew mixed responses, particularly the use of time travel elements. Age of Calamity shipped over 3 million copies worldwide in its first four days, making it the best-selling game in the entire Warriors franchise.
