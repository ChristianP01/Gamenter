Descrizione: Numan Athletics is a 1993 competitive sports arcade game developed and released by Namco. It runs on the company's NA-2 hardware, and has eight unusual competitions to test the strength and might of four mutant athletes called "Numans" (Sharon L'Alles, Harry Boffin, Masaemon Nakamura, and Bongo Tembo). Up to four people can play simultaneously (or, depending upon the event, alternately). The game later went on to spawn a sequel, Mach Breakers: Numan Athletics 2, in 1994; it featured seven brand-new (and selectable) Numans.
