Titolo: Punky Skunk

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Punky Skunk is a side-scrolling action-platform video game developed by Ukiyotei and published by Visit in Japan on 1 November 1996 and later by Jaleco in North America in February 1998 exclusively for the PlayStation. Taking place on a set of island archipi√©lagos where the wolf Badler and his legion of mouse-like Chews are threatening to pollute the locations through industries and machinery, players assume the role of the titular main protagonist in an attempt to overthrow Badler and his BB Brigade army with the help of his companions Nash and Kelly. Its gameplay mainly consists of platforming using a main three-button configuration.
Punky Skunk was conceived by Ukiyotei founder Kenshi Naruse during his time working at the company, who began creating a mascot action game intended for younger audiences reminiscent of Sony's Skyblazer on the Super Famicom as a commission by Bullet-Proof Software but later settled on doing a new title directed towards western audience with Visit using the same game engine after Bullet-Proof Software changed their direction. The arrival of PlayStation in both eastern and western markets led Ukiyotei with suspending development of the project on Super Famicom before ultimately deciding on making a different version for the former platform, while integrating some of their previously established ideas from the original version into the final release.
Upon its release, Punky Skunk was met with mostly negative reception, with critics panning its visual presentation, audio and gameplay.
