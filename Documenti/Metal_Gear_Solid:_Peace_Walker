Titolo: Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is a 2010 stealth game developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami. It is the seventh Metal Gear game written, directed, and designed by Hideo Kojima, and the fifth installment of the Metal Gear Solid series, as well as the fourth Metal Gear game made specifically for the PlayStation Portable, following Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops. The game was later released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as part of the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection in North America and Europe and as a stand-alone retail release in Japan.
Peace Walker is set in Costa Rica in 1974, and follows the exploits of returning protagonist Snake as he runs the mercenary unit Militaires Sans Fronti√®res (Soldiers Without Borders). It was widely acclaimed by critics, but the PlayStation Portable version failed to match the commercial success of its console predecessors due to declining support for the system.
