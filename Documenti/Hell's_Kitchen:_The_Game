Titolo: Hell's Kitchen: The Game

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Hell's Kitchen is a time management cooking video game based on the reality competition show of the same name. It was developed by Ludia and published by Ubisoft. It features the host of the show, Gordon Ramsay as the A.I. and places the player as a chef under his guidance, while serving customers at the restaurant. It was initially released in September 2008 on the Nintendo DS, the Nintendo Wii, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS. Versions for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable were also planned, but these were cancelled prior to the game's release.
The game received mixed reviews, with it being praised for the enjoyment, but scolded for the reported poor controls and the short length. Ludia conceived the game after the release of its video game version of 'The Price Is Right' and shortly after 'Hell's Kitchen' was released, it was followed by Ludia's next game, Where's Waldo? The Fantastic Journey.
