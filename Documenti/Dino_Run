Descrizione: Dino Run is an American independent video game created by PixelJAM and XGen Studios, released on April 30, 2008, in which the player steers a Velociraptor through increasingly dangerous side-scrolling landscapes to escape an impending "wall of doom". The game uses simple pixel art and 8-bit sound to replicate the style of 1980s arcade games. Expanded and improved versions of the game were later released for Macintosh, PC, and Linux under the titles Dino Run SE and Dino Run DX. Two additional games, Dino Run: Marathon Of Doom and Dino Run: Enter Planet D were released as stand-alone titles.
