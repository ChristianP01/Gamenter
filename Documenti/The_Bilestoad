Titolo: The Bilestoad

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: The Bilestoad is a video game by Marc Goodman (credited as "Mangrove Earthshoe") for the Apple II and published in 1982 by Datamost.
In The Bilestoad, players control "meatlings" that hack and battle with axes and shields from a top-view perspective.  The name is derived from the German words Beil (axe) and Tod (death).  The odd spelling reflects Goodman's idea of a future language similar to A Clockwork Orange's Nadsat in which English has been modified by the borrowing of foreign words. Although the game may seem medieval, the backstory in the manual explains that the axe fighting is actually a future virtual reality game designed to reduce real violence.
According to the author, influences for The Bilestoad include the movie Excalibur and Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
