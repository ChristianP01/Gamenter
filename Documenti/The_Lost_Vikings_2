The sequel to The Lost Vikings, it features the original three characters plus two new playable characters: Fang the werewolf and Scorch the dragon. The gameplay remains largely the same, though the three Viking characters all have new or modified abilities.

The SNES version by Blizzard Entertainment continued the use of the more cartoony graphics style seen in the original game.
