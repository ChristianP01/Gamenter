Titolo: The Granstream Saga

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: The Granstream Saga (グランストリーム伝記, Guransutorīmu Denki) is an action role-playing game for the PlayStation. The game was the first 3D title developed by Shade, a development team within Quintet led by graphic designer Kouji Yokota. It is an intended spiritual successor to their previous Super NES titles, Soul Blazer and Terranigma (involving Tomoyoshi Miyazaki and Masanori Hikichi).The Granstream Saga is lauded as one of the first fully polygonal RPGs, as opposed to using polygonal characters with pre-rendered backgrounds, polygonal environments with scaling sprites, or other such combinations. The game features anime-style cutscenes by Production I.G. It is also somewhat unusual in that the characters the player meets in the game are faceless.
