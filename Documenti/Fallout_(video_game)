Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Fallout is a 1997 role-playing video game developed and published by Interplay Productions. The game features a post-apocalyptic and chiefly retro-futuristic setting, taking place in the mid-22nd century decades after a global nuclear war. The protagonist of Fallout is an inhabitant of a Vault, part of a network of long-term nuclear shelters, who is forced to venture out into the wastes to find a replacement part to fix their Vault's failing water supply system and save their fellow Vault dwellers.
Tim Cain is the creator of Fallout, working on it as early as 1994. The game was treated as low-budget by Interplay and was outsourced to the role-playing game division of Interplay, though it would cost $3 million. Fallout was conceptualized as a game where the player could do whatever they wanted. It was initially intended to use Steve Jackson Games' system GURPS, but Interplay eventually developed their own system called "SPECIAL" for the game. Fallout is considered to be the spiritual successor to the 1988 role-playing video game Wasteland. The art style drew inspiration from works from the Atomic Age.
Fallout was critically acclaimed and a financial success. It was praised for its open-ended gameplay, combat, and character system. The game reached 600,000 sales worldwide and is considered one of the best video games of all time. It won "Role-Playing Game of the Year" from both GameSpot and Computer Games Magazine, along with being nominated for an equivalent award by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and Spotlight Awards. Fallout, among other games, has been credited for renewing consumer interest in role-playing video games. It was followed by a number of sequels and spin-off games, collectively known as the Fallout series.
