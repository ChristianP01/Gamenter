Titolo: Golden Sun (video game)

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Golden Sun is a 2001 Japanese role-playing video game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo. It was released in August 2001 for Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, and is the first installment in the Golden Sun series. The game is notable for certain distinctive game elements, such as the use of special Djinn that empower the player and can be used against enemies.
Golden Sun's story follows a band of magic-attuned teenagers called Adepts. The Adepts are on a mission to protect the world of Weyard from alchemy, a potentially destructive power long ago sealed away. During their quest, the Adepts develop new magic abilities (called Psynergy), assist others, and learn more about why alchemy was sealed away. Golden Sun is followed by a sequel, The Lost Age, which changes perspective to follow the antagonists. The two games put together form one complete story.
Golden Sun began as a single planned game for the Nintendo 64 console, but became a mobile title for the Game Boy Advance over the course of around eighteen months of development. Facing hardware constraints, the developers decided to split the game into two.
The game was highly praised by critics; IGN's Craig Harris said that Golden Sun could "arguably be one of the best 2D-based Japanese RPGs created for any system." The game was also commercially successful and sold more than one million copies in Japan and the United States, spawning a series that includes three games and appearances in other media. Golden Sun was re-released for the Virtual Console via the Wii U eShop in April 2014.
