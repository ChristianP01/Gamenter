Titolo: Celeste (video game)

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Celeste is a 2018 platform game designed, directed and written by Maddy Thorson and programmed by Thorson and Noel Berry. It is a fully-fleshed version of the 2016 PICO-8 game of the same name, which was made in four days solely by Thorson and Berry during a game jam. Set on a fictional version of Mount Celeste, it follows a young woman named Madeline who attempts to climb the mountain, and must face her inner demons in her quest to reach the summit.
Celeste was released worldwide independently on January 25, 2018, on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, macOS, and Linux, followed by a release on Stadia on July 28, 2020. It consists of eight chapters, plus a free downloadable content chapter titled Farewell released on September 9, 2019. Farewell acts as an epilogue to the main story and adds 100 new screens.
Celeste received universal acclaim upon release, and was largely considered one of the best games of 2018. It received high praise for its gameplay, level design, soundtrack, themes, and emotional story, as well as for Madeline's characterization; it was also singled out for being demanding yet enjoyable for both casual players, and those seeking to speedrun it or complete all of its optional achievements. It won many awards, including the Best Independent Game and Games for Impact awards at The Game Awards 2018, where it was also nominated for Game of the Year. Celeste was also a financial success, selling over a million copies by the end of 2019 and largely exceeding its creators' expectations, while also becoming a hit in the speedrunning community.
