Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Cho Ren Sha 68K is a 1995 vertically scrolling dōjin shoot 'em up video game developed and originally published by Koichi "Famibe No Yosshin" Yoshida at Comiket for the X68000. Taking place in a ring structure, players take control of the Zanki space fighter craft to fight against an assortment of enemies and bosses.
Cho Ren Sha 68K was first made for the X68000 due to its popularity in the dōjin and freeware development scenes, being influenced by several shoot 'em up games in arcades that also played part with its design process. The game was later ported to Microsoft Windows in 2001, featuring various changes compared to its original release. The title was met with mostly positive reception from reviewers for its presentation, graphics, music and gameplay; criticism was geared towards various design choices but has since gained a cult following, serving as an influence for ZeroRanger (2018).
