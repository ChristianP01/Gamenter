Titolo: Marvel Land

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Marvel Land is a platform arcade game released by Namco in 1990; it runs on the Namco System 2 hardware, and was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive in 1991 (the EU version was also released under an alternative name of Talmit's Adventure.). It also shares its name with the fictitious kingdom in which the 1986 Japan-only Famicom game Valkyrie no B≈çken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu took place but has no connections with it otherwise - and it does not have any connections with Marvel Comics and any of the superheroes associated with them, either.
