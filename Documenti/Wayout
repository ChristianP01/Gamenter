Titolo: Wayout

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Wayout is a 3D first-person perspective video game programmed by Paul Allen Edelstein, originally published for the Atari 8-bit computers in 1982. It was released for the Apple II and Commodore 64 in 1983. Wayout is among the first maze games to offer full 360 degree 3D perspective and movement, and its graphics were considered state-of-the-art upon its release. There were many pseudo-3D maze games at the time (such as 3D Monster Maze, Phantom Slayer, and 3-Demon), but they used a fixed perspective and limited the player to four orientations.
Capture the Flag was published as a follow-up in 1983. It has similar graphics to Wayout, but allows two players to compete at once with a split-screen view, and adds dynamic music.
