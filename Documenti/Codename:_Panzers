Titolo: Codename: Panzers

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Codename: Panzers is a World War II video game created by Hungarian game developer StormRegion. It launched in 2004 to generally favorable reviews. The series entered its second iteration in July 2005 with Codename: Panzers Phase II. A Codename: Panzers Phase III was originally planned, but no longer appears on the official website. It was followed by Codename: Panzers â€“ Cold War. The first two games of the series don't work on 64-bit operating systems due to driver incompatibility of StarForce Protection, however the DRM-free versions available on GOG.com do not contain this issue. But the GOG version relies on VC Redist 2015, which has persistent issues on many computers. Codename: Panzers was intended to be a three-part series portrayal of various conflicts of the Second World War.
The current publishing rights of the franchise belong to THQ Nordic after they acquired the intellectual property rights from the defunct publisher, cdv Software Entertainment.
