Titolo: The Incredible Hulk (Nintendo DS video game)

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: The Incredible Hulk is a 2008 video game published by Sega and developed by Amaze Entertainment for the Nintendo DS. It is based on the film of the same name, following scientist Bruce Banner as he traverses across the Americas in search of a cure to a condition that transforms him into a monstrous being known as the Hulk. Unlike the console game that was concurrently developed and released by Edge of Reality, The Incredible Hulk is presented as a side-scrolling platformer rather than an open world action-adventure title.
The game consists of a 30-level single-player campaign and a local wireless multiplayer mode. To distill and showcase the Hulk's destructive nature, the development team invested in the creation of a new game engine that accommodated fully destructible environments, which affected development time and necessitated additional artists. Reception to The Incredible Hulk was mixed; while reviewers enjoyed the initial feeling of wielding the Hulk's power and appreciated the controls and unlockable content, they criticized the repetitive gameplay and level design, and had lukewarm reactions to the visuals, audio, storyline, and multiplayer mode.
