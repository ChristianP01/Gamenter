Titolo: EyeToy: AntiGrav

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: EyeToy: AntiGrav is a hoverboard game by Harmonix, released in November 2004 for the PlayStation 2. It was touted as the first "real" game for EyeToy targeted to more seasoned gamers. The earlier games such as Play and Groove were geared towards younger players for family or party fun. Unlike the earlier EyeToy games, the player's image is not shown inside the Antigrav game. Instead, the player's movement is reflected in the animated character in the game. The player moves their body to guide the on-screen character through a track. Some obstacles require the player to crouch or jump. Up to 4 players are supported. The game was released in the U.S. in November 2004, and in PAL in March 2005.
