Titolo: Catechumen (video game)

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Catechumen is a Roman-themed first-person shooter video game developed by N'Lightning Software Development. Set in ancient Rome, during the days of the early Christian church, the game follows a young Christian student as he delves deep into a labyrinth of Roman catacombs in order to rescue his mentor and brethren from Satan and his demons. Catechumen was released for Microsoft Windows in September 2000, to mixed reception.
Catechumen is known for being one of the most expensive Christian video games made. N'Lightning spent nearly $830,000 during the development process, although the game's disappointing sales along with its spiritual successor released in 2001, Ominous Horizons: A Paladin's Calling, eventually led to the company's disbandment. According to N'Lightning founder Ralph Bagley, investors were initially hesitant to fund Catechumen's development until after the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999. The two perpetrator's tendencies to play violent video games made a lower-violence video game alternative appealing to investors.
