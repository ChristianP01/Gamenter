Descrizione: Power Instinct, released in Japan as Gōketsuji Ichizoku (豪血寺一族, "Gōketsuji Family"), is a fighting video game series created by Atlus.
The series is known for its absurdist humor. Unique to the series was the introduction of the transformation feature: several of the characters can change their appearance and fighting style by simply executing certain moves (usually a throwing move), though this has not been featured in every entry in the series. Other features include the ability for every character to perform a double jump, run, and attack while running.
