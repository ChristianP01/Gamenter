Titolo: Slap Fight

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Slap Fight is a 1986 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game originally developed by Toaplan and published by Taito. Set on the colonized fictional planet of Theron in the future, where an alien race led by Gaudy have invaded the human-controlled location, players assume the role of an Allied League of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) fighter pilot taking control of the SW475 space fighter craft in a effort to counterattack the invaders. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to other microcomputer and console platforms by various third-party developers, with each one featuring several changes or additions compared to the original release.
Slap Fight proved to be popular for Toaplan among arcades players despite a low number of arcade boards manufactured in Japan, however it was met with mixed reception from video game magazines across western regions, specifically the home conversions. Although it never received a direct sequel, the game's ideas and weapon system were later inherited by both Truxton and Grind Stormer, with the latter being regarded as its spiritual successor. The rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by Masahiro Yuge.
