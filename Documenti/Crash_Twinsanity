Titolo: Crash Twinsanity

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Crash Twinsanity is a 2004 platform video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Vivendi Universal Games (VU Games) for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It is the eleventh installment in the Crash Bandicoot series and the fifth game in the main franchise. The game's story takes place three years after the events of Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex and follows the main protagonist and main antagonist of the series, Crash Bandicoot and Doctor Neo Cortex, who must work together to stop the Evil Twins, a pair of interdimensional parrots, from destroying N. Sanity Island.
Crash Twinsanity began development as Crash Bandicoot Evolution and was intended to have a more serious tone than previous games. The similarity of the game's premise to Ratchet & Clank convinced Traveller's Tales to restart production and create Crash Twinsanity as a comedic title in which Cortex would be teamed up with Crash as a means of exploring his character. The game marks the debut of Lex Lang as the voice of Cortex, replacing previous actor Clancy Brown. Various concepts were removed from the game during production due to time constraints, but were incorporated into the final game as unlockable extras.
Crash Twinsanity received mixed reviews upon release. Critics praised the gameplay variety, visuals, humour and Lang's voice-acting, but had mixed reactions to the music and criticized the camera, controls and platforming sections. Two mobile versions of the game were subsequently released and also met with mixed receptions.
