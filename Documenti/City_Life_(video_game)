Titolo: City Life (video game)

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: City Life is a city-building video game developed by Monte Cristo. It is the first modern building game to allow the player to work in full 3D environment. It is published in France by Focus, in the UK and Germany by Deep Silver and in North America by CDV. It was released in May 2006.
City Life allows players to zoom in and see every little bit of detail. The placement method allows buildings to be placed at an angle, as also seen in Sierra Games' Caesar IV.
More recently, the game has been criticized for lack of many detailed elements, such as weather, disasters, and more "in depth" user control.
