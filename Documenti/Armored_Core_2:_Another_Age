Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Armored Core 2: Another Age is a 2001  third-person shooter mecha video game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 2. It is the fifth entry in the Armored Core series and a direct sequel to Armored Core 2. A reboot of the series, Armored Core 3, was released in 2002 for the PlayStation 2.
Another Age is the final game in the original Armored Core continuity that began with 1997's Armored Core. Five years after Leos Klein's coup in Armored Core 2, the Earth government must contend with corporations rebuilding their influence and a rebel faction attempting to overthrow the existing regime. 
Gameplay is extremely similar to Armored Core 2, changing few of the core mechanics. The Arena is removed from the game, making way for over 100 missions. Minor analog controller support has been added to the game along with a local cooperative mission mode. While only retained in the Japanese version, the game was notable for being the first game in the franchise to include online multiplayer.
