The game is presented through a chat client on Windows XP styled after ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger, specifically their builds in the early-to-mid 2000s, complete with other users' profiles and interface. The choices for profile pictures are generally collected from the culture of the early-to-mid 2000s, including 28 Days Later, The Ring, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, blink-182, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eminem, and Avril Lavigne on the first level. Through special usernames, players can unlock more profile icons referencing early-to-mid 2010s culture, like The Binding of Isaac, Markiplier, Portal, and The Stanley Parable.
