Titolo: Batman: Dark Tomorrow

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Batman: Dark Tomorrow is an action-adventure game developed and published by Kemco for the GameCube and Xbox in 2003. It is based on the DC Comics character Batman and his iteration from the DC Universe source material. Many precedents of the comics are cited, especially as it pertains to Ra's al Ghul, and Batman's "undefined" relationship with al Ghul's daughter, Talia al Ghul.
Initially announced in 2001 as a GameCube exclusive, Batman: Dark Tomorrow was envisioned as being an open-ended, faithful, and realistic approach to the Batman franchise, in a similar vein to the Batman: Arkham series years later. However, as development progressed, the game was scaled back and slated for release on multiple consoles.
Upon release, the game received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, being criticized for its poor controls, camera and technical issues, and is often considered one of the worst video games ever made. A PlayStation 2 version of the game was planned to be released but was cancelled due to the poor reception of the game.
