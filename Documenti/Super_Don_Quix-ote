Titolo: Super Don Quix-ote

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Super Don Quix-ote (スーパードンキホーテ) is an arcade laserdisc video game released by Universal in 1984. In it, the player controls the knight Don as he attempts to rescue a princess from an evil witch.
Super Don Quix-ote is loosely based on the novel Don Quixote, while the laserdisc format is similar to other laserdisc games such as Dragon's Lair and Space Ace. The major difference that set Super Don Quix-ote apart is an overlaid icon indicating the time and direction of each correct quick time event input, whereas all other laserdisc games at the time gave no indication of correct moves, except an occasional "flash" incorporated into the animation itself.
