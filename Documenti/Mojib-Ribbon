Titolo: Mojib-Ribbon

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Mojib-Ribbon (モジブリボン, Mojiburibon) is a music video game created by Masaya Matsuura as a spin-off of his 1999 music game, Vib-Ribbon, which was released for PlayStation. A direct sequel called Vib-Ripple was released in 2004. The releases are comparable to the releases of the earlier PaRappa series (also a Matsuura series) where the original was followed by a pseudo-sequel and then a direct sequel a few years later.
Whereas in Vib-Ribbon the gameplay centered on the player's interaction with the melody of the song being played, in Mojib-Ribbon the gameplay centers on the player's interaction with the lyrics. As such, the music employed in the game is heavily lyrics-oriented rap music. The game's art-style is centered on traditional sumi-e and Japanese kana calligraphy. This has led to claims that the game is incomprehensible to non-Japanese audiences, however the simplicity of gameplay have allowed numerous import gamers (typically also fans of Masaya Matsuura's works) to enjoy the game as well, and guides exist online regarding menu navigation instructions for non-Japanese speakers.
