Titolo: Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout, known in Japan and Europe as Dragon Ball: Final Bout (ドラゴンボール ファイナルバウト, Doragon Bōru Fainaru Bauto), is a fighting game for the PlayStation. The game was developed and released by Bandai in Japan, Europe and North America in 1997, making it the first North American release for a Dragon Ball video game.
Despite the North American title referencing the anime series Dragon Ball GT, the game's story has no direct correlation to Dragon Ball GT, with the cast of playable characters being an equal mix of characters from Dragon Ball GT and its predecessor series Dragon Ball Z. The Dragon Ball GT anime series itself had also not yet been localized for North America until the early 2000s. Reviews for the game from most publications were largely negative.
The game was reissued in Europe in 2002 and in North America in 2004. The game shares the distinction of being the first Dragon Ball game to be rendered in full 3D, and the last Dragon Ball game produced for the PlayStation. There would not be another Dragon Ball game for consoles until the release of Dragon Ball Z: Budokai in 2002.
