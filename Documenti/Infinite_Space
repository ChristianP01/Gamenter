Titolo: Infinite Space

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Infinite Space is a 2009 role-playing video game co-developed by Nude Maker and PlatinumGames for the Nintendo DS. It was published by Sega in 2009 in Japan, and 2010 in Western territories. The science fiction storyline, set across the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, follows the life and growth of Yuri as he first confronts the aggressive expansion of the Lugovalian Empire, then a greater alien threat. Gameplay involves Yuri's fleet travelling across the galaxies, fighting in both scripted battles and random encounters, with the battle system featuring real-time commands and both ships and crew being cutomizable.
The project emerged when producer Atsushi Inaba contacted Nude Maker to produce a title together, as Inaba had enjoyed working with them on Steel Battalion. The story, created by director Hifumi Kono, drew inspiration from numerous Western and Japanese science fiction works, particularly the work of authors Arthur C. Clarke and Greg Egan, and anime creator Yoshiyuki Tomino. The characters were designed by Capcom veterans Sawaki Takeyasu and Tatsuro Iwamoto, while spaceship designs were handled by a large team which included Kazutaka Miyatake of Studio Nue.
The game was produced as one of a four-game publishing deal between PlatinumGames and Sega, acting as their debut in Japan and their third title in the West after MadWorld and Bayonetta. It was promoted in Japan with an anime short film co-produced by Gonzo and Production I.G, released in several parts in both Japanese and English. It saw generally positive reviews, with praise going to its narrative and gameplay mechanics. A common complaint across Japanese and Western critics was its high difficulty. Its sales were disappointing, totalling 200,000 units worldwide, attributed to cartridge manufacturing costs and the narrative's niche appeal.
