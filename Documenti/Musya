Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Musya (Japanese: 豪槍神雷伝説 MUSYA 武者, Hepburn: Gōsō Jinrai Densetsu Musha, lit. "Musha: Legend of the Brave Spearman Jinrai") is a 1992 platform game developed by Jorudan for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was released by Datam Polystar in Japan on April 21, 1992, followed by English localized version produced by SETA USA and released in North America in December 1992. The title, which translates to "Warrior", is romanized in the Kunrei-shiki style (Musya) instead of the Hepburn romanization style (Musha), likely to avoid confusion with the unrelated Sega Genesis game MUSHA.
