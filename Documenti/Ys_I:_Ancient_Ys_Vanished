Descrizione: Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished (イース Ancient Ys Vanished, Īsu), also known as Ys: The Vanished Omens  or The Ancient Land of Ys, is an action role-playing video game developed and published by Nihon Falcom in 1987. It is the first installment in the Ys series. The name is commonly misspelled Y's due to an error on the packaging of an English-language release.
Initially developed for the PC-8801 by Masaya Hashimoto (director, programmer, designer) and Tomoyoshi Miyazaki (scenario writer), the game was soon ported to the X1, PC-9801, FM-7, and MSX2 Japanese computer systems. Ancient Ys Vanished saw many subsequent releases, such as an English-language version for the Master System and an enhanced remake for the TurboGrafx-CD system as part of a compilation called Ys I & II, alongside its 1988 sequel Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished – The Final Chapter. DotEmu has released the game on Android with the following localizations: English, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Italian, German, and Portuguese.
