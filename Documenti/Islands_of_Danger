Titolo: Islands of Danger

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Islands of Danger, also called Rescue, is a game by Richard Carr in which the object is to pilot a hovercraft through seven islands, destroying missile launchers protected by walls. The game is rather memorable for its music and its computer-generated islands made up of open fields, mountain chains, and dense forests. The craft moves at one-fourth speed across swamps (the purple areas).
Islands of Danger was followed by a sequel, Islands of Courage. According to the acknowledgements encoded into the game, Carr spent several months writing these games while he and his wife lived off of their savings.
