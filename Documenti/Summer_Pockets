Descrizione: Summer Pockets is a Japanese visual novel developed by Key, a brand of Visual Arts. It was released on June 29, 2018 for Windows and is rated for all ages. Summer Pockets is Key's 13th game, along with other titles such as Kanon, Air, and Clannad. An expanded version of the game titled Summer Pockets Reflection Blue was released on June 26, 2020 in Japan. Both the original game and Reflection Blue have been ported to iOS and Android devices, and the Nintendo Switch. An English version of the original game for Windows was released by Visual Arts in 2020. The story is set on a fictional island on the Seto Inland Sea and follows the life of Hairi Takahara, a young man who uses the recent death of his grandmother as an excuse to escape to the island after an unpleasant incident. Once there, he gets to know the townsfolk of Torishirojima and multiple girls who are the focus of the story.
The gameplay in Summer Pockets follows an interactive branching plot line with multiple scenarios, and focuses on the player character gaining the favor of the four female main characters; this is expanded to eight in Reflection Blue. The game's concept is by Jun Maeda, but he did not write the scenario due to similarities in themes with Air, which he primarily wrote. Although Air also features a rural, seaside setting during the summer, the development team aimed for Summer Pockets to have a different feeling to it. Nostalgia and the maternal bond are prominent themes in the game.  An anime adaptation has been announced.
