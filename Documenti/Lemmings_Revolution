Titolo: Lemmings Revolution

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Lemmings Revolution is a puzzle video game released in 2000. Like previous games in the Lemmings series, the object of the game is to guide the lemmings characters to an exit by giving them specific skills. Each level is situated on a rotating cylinder (the "revolution" of the title), so while the game is displayed in 3D, it plays much more like the 2D games.
