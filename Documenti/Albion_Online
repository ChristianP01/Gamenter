Titolo: Albion Online

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Albion Online (AP) is a free medieval fantasy MMORPG developed by Sandbox Interactive, a studio based in Berlin, Germany. Albion online is based on The Arthurian legends. During the beta stages of development, players were able to purchase "Founder's Packs" to gain access to the closed beta play-tests which were run intermittently by Sandbox Interactive, typically after an interval of a few months of development. After the release of the game, these founder's packs were made unavailable for purchase. Albion Online removed its free-to-play model for various reasons on December 30, 2015. (Which was then made free again at a later date) When it initially released on July 17, 2017, Albion Online offered a selection of "Starter Packs" which granted players access to the game and offered a varying amount of gold to get started. Once a player purchased any of the starter packs, they would be granted open-ended access to the game with no extra mandatory fees. Players can also purchase membership for a limited amount of time without the benefits of the starter packs. As of April 10, 2019, Albion Online has gone Free to Play. Players can also buy premium with ingame currency (silver).
