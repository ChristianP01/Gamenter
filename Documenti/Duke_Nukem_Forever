Titolo: Duke Nukem Forever

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Duke Nukem Forever is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D Realms and published by 2K Games for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is the fourth main installment in the Duke Nukem series and a sequel to 1996's Duke Nukem 3D. Players control the eponymous action hero as he comes out of retirement to battle an alien invasion.
The game endured a severely protracted development that lasted 15 years. Announced in 1997 following the success of Duke Nukem 3D, Duke Nukem Forever underwent several delays, which led to 3D Realms stating in 2001 that the game would be released "when it's done". After losing its development team in 2009 due to 3D Realms downsizing, the game was finished by Triptych Games, Gearbox Software, and Piranha Games. Duke Nukem Forever was released on June 14, 2011, to mostly unfavorable reviews from critics, who criticized the graphics, dated humor and story, simplistic mechanics, and unpolished performance and design.
