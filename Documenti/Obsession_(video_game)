Titolo: Obsession (video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Obsession is a pinball video game developed and originally published by Unique Development Sweden for the Atari STe on December 2, 1994. It is the first video game to be created by UDS and one of the last official releases for the Atari ST platform after being discontinued in 1993 by Atari Corporation. In the game, players can choose between any of the four available playfields, both of which have their own thematic and main objectives in order to obtain the highest score possible.
Obsession served as the debut title of Unique Development Sweden, a development company consisting of Atari ST demosceners, composers and artists founded in 1992 by Peter Zetterberg and Michael Brunnstr√∂m, both of which began writing games for the Atari STe and found the idea of earning money from their hobby as appealing. The original idea was to develop a shareware game inspired by Pinball Dreams for the STe at the level of an earlier release by Zetterberg before the project was expanded upon, as UDS settled with developing a pinball project with a "no compromise" approach due to the lack of quality pinball titles on the ST but its scope grew too much during development and the team struggled to get the title working and ship it on schedule.
Obsession was met with acclaim from critics when it was first released on the Atari STe, garnering praise for pushing limits of the STe hardware, its audiovisual presentation, controls and gameplay but criticized for various design aspects and sold very few copies. The game was later ported to the Amiga on June 1, 1995, a conversion commended by reviewers but received criticism for certain aspects compared to the STe original while others drew comparison with both the Pinball series by Digital Illusions and 21st Century Entertainment, as well as Dragon's Fury. Ports for the Amiga 1200, Atari Falcon, PC and Atari Jaguar were under development but never released, however the PC version evolved into a follow-up with new tables and features titled Absolute Pinball (1996).
