Descrizione: Champion of the Raj is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Level 9 Computing and published by Personal Software Services. It was released exclusively in the United Kingdom for the Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM PC compatibles in 1991. It is the thirteenth and final instalment in the Strategic Wargames series. The game revolves around European imperialism and colonialism in India. Six factions–British, French, Mogul, Sikhs, Gurkhas, and Marathas–fight to gain overall control of India.
The core of the gameplay is focused on strategy, in which the player must conquer all territories of India through diplomatic or offensive means. It also contains action sequences, including traditional elephant racing and big-game hunting. Critics praised its colourful graphics and storyline, but strongly disliked the long load times and frequent disk swapping.
