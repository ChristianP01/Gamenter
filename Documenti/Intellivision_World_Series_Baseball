Titolo: Intellivision World Series Baseball

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball is a baseball video game (1983) designed by Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower, and published by Mattel for the Intellivision Entertainment Computer System. IWSB was one of the first sports video games to use multiple camera angles and present a three-dimensional (as opposed to two-dimensional) perspective. It was also the first statistics-based baseball simulation game on a video game console; all prior console baseball games were arcade-style recreations of the sport.
The game's full formal title (due to licensing requirements) was Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball.  It was typically shortened to World Series Baseball in use to differentiate it from the prior Mattel baseball game.
