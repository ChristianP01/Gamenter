Titolo: Military Madness

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Military Madness is a 1989 turn-based strategy video game originally developed and published by Hudson Soft in Japan and NEC in North America for the TurboGrafx-16. It is the first entry in the Nectaris series. Set in the year 2089, players take command of the Allied-Union forces in a desperate offense against the Axis-Xenon Empire army on the Moon before they launch the S.A.M. (Supreme Atomic Missile) weapon to obliterate Earth. Its gameplay consists of moving units into positions to confront enemies in turn-based encounters determined by multiple factors, capturing factories to produce resources and repair units in order to occupy the enemy prison camp or destroy all enemy forces.
Military Madness was later ported to other platforms, each one featuring several changes and additions compared to the original TurboGrafx-16 version, in addition of re-releases through download services for other systems, among other ways to play it. The game garnered positive reception from critics, some of which praised the audiovisual presentation and favourably compared its gameplay with other titles in the same genre such as Desert Commander and Advance Wars but others criticized several aspects, while other versions were also met with similarly positive reception from reviewers as well. It was also cited as a key influence on Dune II. A sequel, Neo Nectaris, was released in 1994 for the PC Engine Super CD-ROMÂ² add-on.
