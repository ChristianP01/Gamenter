Titolo: Alvin and the Chipmunks (video game)

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Alvin and the Chipmunks is a 2007 video game based on the film of the same name. It follows The Chipmunks as they play their way from small venues (such as a high school prom or a civic center) to massive crowds at Burning Munk and ultimately Rockathonapalooza. The soundtrack features 40 songs, including "All the Small Things" by Blink-182, "It's Tricky" by Run-D.M.C., and "Heartbreak Hotel" by Elvis Presley. The gameplay itself is similar to other rhythm games such as Rock Band and Guitar Hero. Jason Lee reprised his role as David Seville in the story cutscenes while Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and Janice Karman reprise their roles from the 1980s-2000s cartoons.
A second installment, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, was released on December 1, 2009 to coincide with the release of the film of the same name.
