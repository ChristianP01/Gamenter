Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Excitebike: World Rally, known as Excitebike: World Race in Japan and Excitebike: World Challenge in the PAL region, is a racing game released as a WiiWare title for the Wii game console. It is the fifth and most recent title in the Excite racing series, and is the first since the original Excitebike to feature classic 2D racing. The game was developed by Monster Games, and is their third developed game in the series. The title was announced on October 27, 2009 through the NOA edition of the Nintendo Channel, via an episode of Nintendo Week, and was released shortly after in North America on November 9, in Japan on February 2, 2010 and in the PAL region on February 5.
World Rally borrows the same concept as the racing title released for the NES in 1984. The game's core design is that of a time trial arcade racer; that is, each race sees players attempting to get to the finish line in the shortest period of time possible. In contrast to that NES game, the game includes an online multiplayer mode, allowing players to play anonymously over the internet, or with friends in a similar fashion to Mario Kart Wii. The game received mixed to positive reviews from critics.
