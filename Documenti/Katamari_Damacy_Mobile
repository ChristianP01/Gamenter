Descrizione: Katamari Damacy Mobile (塊魂モバイル, Katamari Damashii Mobairu) is a video game developed by Namco Bandai Games for the Mitsubishi P904i series of mobile phones for NTT Docomo.  It was released in June 2007 in Japan.  It is a spin-off of the Katamari Damacy series, the second game on a handheld game console and the third game produced without the involvement of series creator Keita Takahashi.
This version of the game uses a unique method of control, by making use of a new software technology called GestureTek EyeMobile to make phones capable of detecting tilt and vibration via the built in camera on the P904i.  The player moves the katamari ball forward, backwards, left and right by tilting the phone.
There are traditional controls as an option to the default motion controls.
Katamari Damacy Mobile came pre-installed on P904i model phones. Other phone models needed to download the game through the Bandai Namco Games channel.
