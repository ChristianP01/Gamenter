Anno: 2000

Descrizione: BattleSphere is a first-person space combat simulation video game originally developed by 4Play and published by ScatoLOGIC exclusively for the Atari Jaguar on February 29, 2000.Taking place in the future where seven races have colonized and destroyed multiple planets due to their actions, the leaders of each race send their best pilots into an inclosed region of space called BattleSphere to either gain privilege of occupy the remaining habitable stars or return to their original dying planets. Originally conceived in 1993 before the Jaguar was officially released to the market, BattleSphere is heavily influenced by multiple science fiction works and video games, most notably Star Raiders.Initially released in 2000, a second version of the game was released in 2002 under the title BattleSphere Gold, which added new features and improvements compared to the original version and in 2006 a third, one-of-a-kind version titled BattleSphere Trio was auctioned on eBay and has additional features not available on the Gold version. The first copy of the original version was sold on eBay for over US$1500, with the auction proceeds going to diabetes research, while all after-tax profits from subsequently sold copies of every version of the title were invested into diabetes charity.Despite being published after the platform was discontinued by Atari Corporation in 1996 and being declared as open platform by Hasbro Interactive one year prior to release, BattleSphere received positive reception from reviewers when it launched with praise towards the graphics, music, gameplay, replay value and multiplayer modes, with several publications such as GameFan, Next Generation and Retro Gamer referring it as one of the best games released for the Jaguar. Plans of porting the game to other systems were in consideration but none ever entered into development after several unsuccessful attempts to various publishers.
