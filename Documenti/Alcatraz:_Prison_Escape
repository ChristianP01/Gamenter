Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Alcatraz: Prison Escape is an action survival video game. It was developed by Zombie Inc. and was published by Activision Value. The game was released worldwide on November 26, 2001 exclusively for the Microsoft Windows platform. Players control a falsely accused person as he attempts to escape six different types of prisons in order to prove his innocence in the outside world. Players have to sneak past guards in order to make it through every prison level. If seen, an alarm is rung that forces players to hide temporarily.The name of the title was kept under wraps until late in the development cycle; causing the programming team to create a makeshift Alcatraz level by inserting fog horns, seagulls and a crudely drawn Golden Gate Bridge.
