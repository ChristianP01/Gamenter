Titolo: Diamond Trust of London

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Diamond Trust of London is a turn-based strategy video game by Jason Rohrer, with music by Tom Bailey. Following a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter the game was published by indiePub and released for the Nintendo DS on August 28, 2012. The game has been placed in the public domain and is hosted on SourceForge.Inspired by German-style board games, Diamond Trust of London is played between two players, each controlling a diamond trading company.  The game is set in 2000, before the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme to curb the blood diamond trade, and the player's aim is to extract diamonds from Angola over the nine turns which comprise a game.  To extract the most diamonds and win, players resort to a combination of bribery and deception.
First pitched in 2009, Diamond Trust of London went through a protracted development process, going through two publishers and taking over three years to reach the market.  To raise capital for the game's manufacture, Rohrer launched a Kickstarter campaign, where it became the first successfully crowdfunded Nintendo DS game.  Critics had reservations about the amount of content on offer and the game's user interface, but were appreciative of the psychological gameplay and the themes explored.
