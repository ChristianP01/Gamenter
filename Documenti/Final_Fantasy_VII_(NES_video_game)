Titolo: Final Fantasy VII (NES video game)

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Final Fantasy VII is an unlicensed "Shanzhai" demake of SquareSoft's role-playing game of the same name, originally released for PlayStation in 1997. This two-dimensional "port" was developed and published by Chinese company Shenzhen Nanjing Technology for Subor, a Nintendo's Family Computer clone console series (internationally known as the NES). The cartridge itself is unique, as it is structurally different from licensed Famicom cartridges in terms of hardware and programming.
The title features many gameplay elements of the original counterpart, including a three-member party structure and adaptations of the game's subsystems. Items, spells and equipment available to the player are based upon those in the original game, and although a large number have been omitted along with optional characters and some side quests, the original story was reproduced in very minute detail. Its receptions were mixed, cited as an impressive achievement but at the same time criticized for the difficulty and choice of a target console.
