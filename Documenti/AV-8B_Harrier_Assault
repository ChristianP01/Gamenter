Titolo: AV-8B Harrier Assault

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: AV-8B Harrier Assault is a combat flight simulator/realtime strategy game developed by Simis and first published by Domark in 1992. An updated version using SVGA graphics was released later the same year, alternatively known as SVGA Harrier. In 1994, a modified version of the SVGA version was released for the classic Mac OS under the new name Flying Nightmares, which was later ported to 3D0.
In contrast to most simulators of the era, Harrier Assault puts the user in control of the overall battle, assigning missions to both air and ground forces. The game starts with a pre-rolled battle plan which the user can modify as the game progresses, or replace outright from the start. Some of the missions of the overall plan involve flying the Harriers, which the player can fly or leave to the computer.
