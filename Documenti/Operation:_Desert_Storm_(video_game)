Titolo: Operation: Desert Storm (video game)

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Operation: Desert Storm is a top-down tank shooter for the Macintosh. It is the first commercial game released by Bungie and the first game since their incorporation, following the freeware title Gnop!, published by Bungie co-founder Alex Seropian under the Bungie name prior to incorporation. It sold about 2,500 copies and was based on Operation Desert Storm, a conflict in the Middle East that was going on at the time.
The game features twenty levels, culminating in the city of Baghdad with the final enemy being a giant Saddam Hussein head. It comes with a glossary of military terms and trivia which was needed in order to bypass the copy-protection in the game, and authentic maps of the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations.
