Titolo: King's Field (video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: King's Field is a first-person role-playing video game (RPG) developed and published by FromSoftware for the PlayStation in December 1994. The debut title of the King's Field series, the game has players navigating a vast underground labyrinth to discover the source of an invasion of monsters. Attacking and using spells are tied to a stamina meter, which is depleted with each action and must refill before the player can act again.
The game—FromSoftware's first video game production—was initially planned as a title for personal computers before shifting to the Playstation, which they felt had better specs. It was developed in around six months by a small internal team. Upon release, the game was a commercial success, though receiving mixed reviews from critics. King's Field is one of the earliest known 3D console role-playing games, predating later more famous titles such as Final Fantasy VII. The game not only spawned multiple sequels, but would go on to inspire future FromSoftware titles including Shadow Tower, and the Souls series.
