Titolo: ARMA: Armed Assault

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: ARMA: Armed Assault (stylized as ARMA; known as ARMA: Combat Operations in North America) is a tactical military first- and third-person shooter, released in 2006.
ARMA is the spiritual successor to Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and features an overhauled game engine, with improved graphics, physics, multiplayer functionality, scripting capabilities, and new units and vehicles. An expansion pack titled ARMA: Queen's Gambit was released in 2007.
Because of legal issues between Bohemia Interactive and Codemasters (the original publishers of Operation Flashpoint), Codemasters owns the intellectual property to the name Operation Flashpoint. Since Bohemia Interactive severed its connection with Codemasters and no longer has the legal right to use the Operation Flashpoint name, Armed Assault is considered to be the direct descendant of Operation Flashpoint. ARMA 2 (previously referred to as "Game 2") was released in June 2009. Codemasters has released a rival title to Bohemia Interactive using the name Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, in which Bohemia Interactive has no participation.
