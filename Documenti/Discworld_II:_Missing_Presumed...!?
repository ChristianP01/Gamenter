Descrizione: Discworld II: Missing Presumed...!? (released as Discworld II: Mortality Bytes! in North America) is a 1996 point-and-click adventure game based on Terry Pratchett's series of fantasy novels set on the mythical Discworld, and sequel to the 1995 video game of the same name. The story sees players assume the role of Rincewind the "wizzard" as he becomes burdened with the task of finding Death and coercing him out of an impromptu retirement and back into his regular duties. The game's plot borrows from a number of Discworld books, including key elements from Reaper Man and Moving Pictures.
The game was developed in 1996 by Perfect Entertainment and published by Psygnosis for the PC, and featured the return of Eric Idle in his role as Rincewind in the previous game. The game was ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1997. The Saturn port was exclusive for the European market. The game received positive reviews across Europe, but fared less well in North America.
