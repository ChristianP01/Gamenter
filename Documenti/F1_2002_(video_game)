Descrizione: F1 2002 is a racing video game published by Electronic Arts and released for Xbox, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, GameCube and Game Boy Advance. The game was based on the 2002 season.
Strangely, Hockenheimring and NÃ¼rburgring both still use their original layouts, and BMW Williams F1 Team use Compaq logos before being bought by HP. This was rectified in the Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Advance versions.
