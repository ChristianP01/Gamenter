Descrizione: Last Ranker is a 2010 role-playing video game developed by Imageepoch and published by Capcom for the PlayStation Portable. Set in a fantasy world where warriors are ranked by Bazalta, the world's ruling military and government who are dedicated to fighting hostile beings called the Evinos. Zig, a young man from the nomadic Cantalera tribe, decides to enter Bazalta and reach its top ranks. He ends up allied with a rebel group and fighting against both Bazalta and the Evinos. Gameplay combines mission-based explorations, and combat featuring players controlling Zig in real-time during turn-based battles.
The game was created by director Kazuya Niinou, based on his love of tournament-style fights in sh≈çnen manga and his wish to create a title fitting for Capcom's history of fighting games. The team featured industry veterans including Capcom producer Minae Matsukawa, illustrators Tatsuya Yoshikawa and Shin Nagasawa, and composer Yoko Shimomura. The scenario was created by Final Fantasy writer Kazushige Nojima, who also created supplemental novellas expanding on the narrative and characters.
The game remains exclusive to Japan, a fact attributed to the platform's weak market presence overseas. Last Ranker saw generally positive reviews from Japanese critics, with many citing its gameplay as standing out from other RPGs of the time. Debuting in the top ten best-selling titles of the week, it sold over 100,000 units during 2010. It was supported by two guidebooks, two mangas, and two CD dramas written by Nojima.
