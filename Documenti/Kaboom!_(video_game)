Descrizione: Kaboom! is an action video game published in 1981 by Activision for the Atari VCS (renamed to the Atari 2600 in 1982). It was programmed by Larry Kaplan, and David Crane coded the overlaid sprites. The game was well received and sold over one million cartridges by 1983.Kaboom! is an unauthorized adaptation of the 1978 Atari, Inc. arcade video game Avalanche. The gameplay of both is fundamentally the same, but Kaboom! was re-themed to be about a mad bomber instead of falling rocks. Ex-Atari programmer Larry Kaplan originally wanted to port Avalanche to the Atari 2600. In Avalanche all the boulders are lined up at the top which is difficult to accomplish on the 2600, so the design was adjusted.Atari 8-bit family and Atari 5200 ports followed in 1983.
