Titolo: Assault (1983 video game)

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Assault is a 1983 fixed shooter video game developed and published by Bomb for the Atari 2600. Controlling a spaceship fixated at the bottom of the screen, gameplay involves the player shooting projectiles towards an enemy mothership that deploys smaller ships to attack the player. The player must also prevent enough projectiles from touching the bottom of the screen.
Assault was produced by Bomb, a video game developer based out of Asia. It received lukewarm reviews from critics upon release, many referring to it as a rip-off of games such as Galaxian and Demon Attack and criticizing its graphics. Some reviewers did state that despite being unoriginal, was still fun to play, labeling it one of Bomb's better releases for the 2600.
