Descrizione: Little Britain: The Video Game is a collection of mini-games by British studios Gamerholix and Gamesauce and published by Mastertronic Group under their Blast! Entertainment label. It is presented in the format of an episode from the TV show. Players can interact with the sketch show characters in a series of seven mini-games featuring Lou and Andy, Vicky Pollard, Emily and Florence, Marjorie Dawes, Daffyd Thomas, Judy & Maggie and Letty. Each mini game plays like a sketch from the TV show and to win the game, the player must progress through all the sketches to the end of the show, where the credits will roll.  The game's reception was incredibly negative, and has appeared on many lists as one of the worst games ever made.
