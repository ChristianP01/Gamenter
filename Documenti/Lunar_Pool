Titolo: Lunar Pool

Anno: 1985

Descrizione: Lunar Pool (known as Lunar Ball (ルナーボール, Runā Bōru) in Japan) is a video game that combines pool (pocket billiards) with aspects of miniature golf, created and developed by Compile for the Nintendo Entertainment System and MSX, in which each stage is a differently shaped pool table. The object is to knock each ball into a pocket using a cue ball. There are sixty levels to choose from, and the friction of the table is adjustable (thus the lunar reference in the title, along with Moon-related background imagery within the game).
The Japanese Lunar Ball appeared on Famicom clone systems and pirated multi-game cartridges, such as the Power Player Super Joy III. It was released for the Wii on the North American Virtual Console on October 22, 2007.
