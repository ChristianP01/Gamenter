Titolo: Dream Match Tennis

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Dream Match Tennis is a 2006 tennis simulation game developed by Bimboosoft, a company based in Saitama, Japan. Unlike other games in its genre, Dream Match Tennis was aimed to produce a more realistic depiction of the sport, requiring more skill from the player in order to direct their shots accurately.
Due to the small size of the Bimboosoft Company, they were not able to use the same level of graphical effects in Dream Match Tennis as other companies such as Sega could with games like Virtua Tennis 3.
This page refers to the "Pro" version of the game: v. 2.37 is the latest demo version.
During the year 2021 it was released by Bimboosoft as free full version (v. 3.00).
