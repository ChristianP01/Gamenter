Titolo: Iron Soldier

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Iron Soldier is an open world first-person mecha simulation video game developed by Eclipse Software Design and published by Atari Corporation for the Atari Jaguar in North America and Europe on December 22, 1994, then in Europe in January 1995 and later in Japan on March 24 of the same year, where it was instead published by Mumin Corporation. The first installment in the eponymous franchise, the game is set in a dystopian future where industries and machinery has overrun most of the surface on Earth, as players assume the role of a resistance member taking control of the titular mech in an attempt to overthrow the dictatorship of Iron Fist Corporation, who have conquered the world through usage of military force.
Conceived by Cybermorph co-producer Sean Patten during his time working at Atari Corp., Iron Soldier began development in late 1993 during the console's launch and was jointly written by Lethal Xcess authors Marc Rosocha and Michael Bittner. Eclipse Software originally pitched an on-rails 3D shooter to the Atari executives but it was rejected for not being an open world title, however Marc later meet with Patten, who proposed him to create a mecha game based on a script he previously wrote that served as the starting basis for the project, which took influences from his fascination with mechas and series such as Godzilla.
Iron Soldier received mostly positive reception after being released and critics praised multiple aspects of the game such as the visuals, audio, gameplay and overall design but its control scheme, learning curve and lack of additional texture-mapped graphics drew criticism from some of the reviewers. As of April 1, 1995, the title has sold nearly 21,000 copies though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime. A sequel, Iron Soldier 2, was released in December 1997 by Telegames for both the Jaguar and Atari Jaguar CD, a year after both platforms were discontinued by Atari in 1996 for being critical and commercial failures. In recent years, it has been referred by several publications as one of the best titles for the system.
