Titolo: Madden NFL 97

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Madden NFL 97 is a football video game released in 1996. It was the first multiplatform Madden game released for the 32-bit consoles (following a 3DO-exclusive version simply titled John Madden Football in 1994), being released on both, the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. 16-bit versions were also made for the established Super NES and Genesis platforms, as well as a portable version for the Game Boy.
This is the first edition of Madden to implement a salary cap when customizing team rosters. It also features the new Baltimore Ravens, formerly the Cleveland Browns for the 1996 season. The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96), which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and can be played by using a cheat code.
Madden NFL 97 was the best-selling PlayStation game of 1996.
