Titolo: Amy (video game)

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Amy is a survival horror stealth video game, released in 2012, developed by VectorCell and published by Lexis Num√©rique. Amy depicts the journey of Amy, an autistic child with supernatural powers, and her protector Lana. In a city suffering from a zombie-type infection which Amy is immune to (and can heal Lana from), Lana must stay near her young charge, for frequent healing, while protecting her from the infected, and the Phoenix Foundation who hopes to exploit her. Amy received negative critical reviews, due to technical issues, clunky controls, voice-acting, game design, and poorly implemented gameplay and story ideas, although its story concept, gameplay ideas, music, sound design and art direction were praised, with most noting that it had unique ideas and a good atmosphere. Updates were released to address some of the complaints, primarily technical issues.
