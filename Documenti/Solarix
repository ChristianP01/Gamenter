Titolo: Solarix

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Solarix is a 2015 Science-Fiction Stealth-based first-person shooter survival horror video game developed by Pulsetense Games and published by KISS Ltd for Windows OS. It was developed using the Unreal Development Kit and is the first video game developed by the Turkish-based Pulsetense Games. The game is intended as a homage to stealth-focused first-person video games of the late 1990s and early 2000s, particularly System Shock 2 and the Thief series. It was released on April 30, 2015 on the Steam digital distribution service. It has received mixed reviews.
In Solarix, players take the role of engineer Walter Terrace, the sole civilian survivor of a viral infection that has wiped out a Solarix corporation space colony on the planet Ancyra. Walter must evade zombified colonists as well as hostile corporate mercenary soldiers, while following instructions provided by the colony's A.I. administrator, AMI, in an attempt to stop the infection.
In 2016 Pulsetense Games released De-Void, a narrative exploration game which serves as an "anti-sequel" to Solarix, which uses the same location and general setting, but has an entirely different plot which is deliberately not entirely consistent with the one presented in Solarix.
In 2017, Pulsetense Games released Planet Ancyra Chronicles, a compilation of Solarix and De-Void with the combat and enemies removed from the Solarix content. The game was made available for free to players who already owned either Solarix or De-Void.
In 2018, Pulsetense Games released ReFramed, a rebalanced version of Solarix using action-shooter FPS gameplay instead of the original game's stealth-based gameplay, which also removed the psychological elements of the game's plot.
