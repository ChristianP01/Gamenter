Titolo: Operation Crusader (video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Operation Crusader is a 1994 computer wargame developed by Atomic Games and published by Avalon Hill.
Operation Crusader was among the first titles released in Avalon Hill's push to revive its computer game division during the 1990s, in an attempt to diversify its business because of falling board wargame sales. The company hired Atomic Games as a key to this initiative, and Crusader acted as the spiritual success to its earlier V for Victory wargame series, reusing and updating much of the game design and code from those titles.
Operation Crusader was the first game in the World at War series, and was followed by World at War: Stalingrad and D-Day: America Invades.
