Players assume control of a medieval state, referred to in the game as a faction, and control its government, economy, military, diplomacy, and religion on a map spanning most of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. In battles, players control groups of soldiers and engage in combat with enemy forces.
Medieval II received mostly positive reviews from critics. Many reviewers regarded the game as an improvement over its predecessors, but criticized its lack of innovation. An expansion pack, Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms, was released in 2007.
