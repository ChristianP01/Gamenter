Anno: 1985

Descrizione: Dun Darach is an arcade adventure developed and published in 1985 by Gargoyle Games for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC computers. It is a prequel to the 1984 game Tir Na Nog. The plot has Celtic hero Cuchulainn on a search to find his companion LÃ³eg in the mysterious city of Dun Darach. Inspiration for the game came from the works of Fritz Lieber and Michael Moorcock.
The background history is based on Celtic folklore about the demigod Cuchulainn and his battles against the people of Connachta in ancient Ireland. Dun Darach was critically acclaimed upon its original release, with praise singling out its graphics. Retrospective reviews were less than positive, with one reviewer preferring Tir Na Nog. It was re-released on different game compilations and cover tapes in issues of British video game magazines.
