Descrizione: Delta Force: Black Hawk Down – Team Sabre is the expansion pack to Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. Team Sabre adds more weapons, that can be used in servers that only have Delta Force: Black Hawk Down.  The Team Sabre expansion gives the player a new character to choose, the British elite commando unit SAS. Team Sabre adds a few more terrains which are mostly jungle and desert terrains. The expansion pack also gives the player two more campaigns which are in fictional based areas, fighting the renegade general Haatim Jaareah Kalb in the deserts of Iran and the elusive drug lord Antonio Paulo in the jungles of Colombia. The main difference from the original is the difficulty, with fewer saves and longer levels.
Sierra Entertainment and Novalogic announced in October 2006 that a PlayStation 2 version of Delta Force: Black Hawk Down: Team Sabre was being released in late November 2006. The video game, developed by Rebellion Developments, is a completely redeveloped version of Team Sabre featuring additional weapons and vehicles not seen in the original PlayStation 2 version of Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. At the same time, a Mobile phone version of the game was released in fall 2006.
