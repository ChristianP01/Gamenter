Descrizione: Tombs & Treasure, known in Japan as Asteka II: Templo del Sol (太陽の神殿: ASTEKA II, Taiyō no Shinden: Asutekā Ni, "Temple of the Sun: Asteka II"), is an adventure game originally developed by Falcom in 1986 for the PC-8801, PC-9801, FM-7, MSX 2 and X1 Japanese computer systems. A Famicom/NES version, released in 1988, was altered to be more story-based, and features new music and role-playing elements; an English-language NES version was published by Infocom in 1991. Japanese enhanced remakes were released for the Saturn and Windows systems in 1998 and 1999, respectively.
The game takes place in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza on the Yucatán Peninsula. It alternates between using a three-quarters overhead view for travelling from ruin to ruin, and switching to a first-person perspective upon entering a specific location.
