Descrizione: Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon is a 2008 point-and-click adventure video game developed by Kheops Studio for Microsoft Windows, and published by MC2 France under their Micro√Øds label in Europe and Encore in North America. In 2010, an abridged version of the game developed by Tetraedge Games and published by Chillingo was released in a three-part episodic form for iOS (as Dracula: The Path of the Dragon). The full version of the game was ported to OS X in 2010, published by Coladia. Also in 2010, the three-part iOS version was made available for PC as the Dracula Series. In 2014, the abridged iOS version was made available as a single game on Steam.The game follows 2000's Dracula: Resurrection and Dracula: The Last Sanctuary, although the storyline is unrelated to either game. Path of the Dragon takes place in 1920, and follows Father Arno Moriani of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, who is sent to the village of Vladoviste in the diocese of Alba Iula in Transylvania to investigate the possible canonization of a recently deceased doctor,  Martha Calugarul. However, Moriani soon learns Calugarul believed herself to have been engaged in a battle with a vampire, possibly Dracula himself, and although initially skeptical of the story, he slowly comes to believe there may be some validity to it. A loose sequel to Path of the Dragon was released in a two-part form in 2013; Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon and Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy.
Path of the Dragon was most widely reviewed for the PC, where it received mixed reviews. Most critics praised the graphics, music, sound effects and voice acting, but the gameplay and puzzles received a more mixed response, with some finding the puzzles too esoteric and/or illogical, and others feeling they fit the nature of the game well.
