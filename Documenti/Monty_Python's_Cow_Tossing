Descrizione: Monty Python's Cow Tossing is a catapult-physics game. It was developed by South African studio Luma Arcade and released by Zed Worldwide on February 3, 2011 for Android, iOS, and J2ME. The game is similar in style to Angry Birds and Crush the Castle, and includes the premise of firing cows at Englishmen who are located in structures built of concrete, wood, and other materials. It is based on the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail "in which French militiamen hurl a heifer onto a band of English relic seekers", and to further tie-in to the movie, "funny quotes from the movie appear in bubbles over the characters".
