Titolo: The Horde (video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: The Horde is a hybrid action-strategy video game that was originally released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and was ported to the Sega Saturn and DOS. It also featured full-motion video sequences featuring a number of actors including Kirk Cameron as Chauncey and Michael Gregory as Kronus Maelor. Video sequences were reduced to slide shows (with full sound) in some versions.
The game was bundled with the RealMagic MPEG playback card as a demonstration of the card's abilities to play back full-motion MPEG video via the card's hardware decoder, at the time software MPEG decoding was not viable due to the lack of processing power in contemporary processors.
The music was composed by Burke Trieschmann and won Computer Gaming World's Premiere Award for Best Musical Score in 1994.
