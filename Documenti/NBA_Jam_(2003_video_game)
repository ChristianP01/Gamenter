The game also features various courts and special teams, including all-star teams composed of various NBA legends. It is the last NBA Jam released by Acclaim, as the company became defunct the following year.
NBA Jam would also be the last Jam game released until Electronic Arts revived the franchise with its 2010 NBA Jam game.
