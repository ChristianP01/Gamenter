Descrizione: Build-A-Bear Workshop is a simulation video game for the Nintendo DS based on the retailer of the same name. It was developed by French company Neko Entertainment and published by The Game Factory for release on November 5, 2007. A follow-up, known as Build-A-Bear Workshop: A Friend Fur All Seasons, was released for the Wii in 2008. Two additional video games, Build-A-Bear Workshop: Welcome to Hugsville and Build-A-Bear Workshop: Friendship Valley, were released for the Nintendo DS and Wii, respectively, in 2010. Since The Game Factory went out of business before they were released, both games were published by Activision instead.In the game, players use the touch screen (the buttons and microphone are not used often) to do activities and play with their bear. The player can choose one of six bears and customize it with clothes, accessories and shoes.
