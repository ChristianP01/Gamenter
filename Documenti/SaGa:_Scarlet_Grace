Descrizione: SaGa: Scarlet Grace is a role-playing video game co-developed by Square Enix and Studio Reel. The twelfth entry in the SaGa series, the game was published by Square Enix in 2016 for the PlayStation Vita. An expanded port subtitled Ambitions was released in 2018 in Japan and in 2019 worldwide for Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. The story follows four characters pursuing separate missions across the splintered remains of a dissolved Empire; central to the plot is the Firebringer, a rebellious deity defeated during the Empire's height. Gameplay focuses on the protagonists exploring the nonlinear world, taking part in turn-based battles where skill growth depends on chosen actions.
The game was the series' first original console title since 2002's Unlimited Saga, with development beginning in 2013 to celebrate the series' 25th anniversary. Returning staff included series creator Akitoshi Kawazu as co-designer and scenario writer, artist Tomomi Kobayashi, and composer Kenji Ito. The team designed several aspects of the game based on player feedback from Unlimited SaGa, and incorporated features from both SaGa Frontier and the Romancing SaGa games. Ambitions began development following Scarlet Grace, with improvements based on feedback from the original. The Western version was localised by 8-4. Reception of the game was generally positive, with critics praising its gameplay and design.
