Descrizione: Tanktics: Computer Game of Armored Combat on the Eastern Front, also named Wargy I, is a 1976 two-player tank battle video game by Chris Crawford. It was Crawford's first video game; it was initially sold directly by him since its initial creation in 1976, as publisehd by Avalon Hill in 1981 under the name Tanktics. The game has no graphics; the player moves tokens on a physical map to represent a tank battle, with the computer controlling one of the sides. The game received weak reviews by critics, who found the artificial intelligence to be weak and suited for players who wanted neither a complex nor fast-paced game.
