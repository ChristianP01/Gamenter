Titolo: Trade Wars

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Trade Wars is a series of video games dating back to 1984.  Inspired by Hunt the Wumpus, the board game Risk, and the original space trader game Star Trader, Trade Wars was the first multiplayer game of the space trader genre.  The original Trade Wars, created by Chris Sherrick (1984), inspired a long line of Tradewars-like games, including the seminal Tradewars 2002, which has been cited as an influence by many developers and was named the 10th best PC game by PC World in 2009.  Later space traders have often been compared to Tradewars 2002, including Eve Online, Jumpgate and the X Series.
