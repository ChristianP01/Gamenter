Titolo: Take On Mars

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Take On Mars is a simulation video game for Windows, developed by Bohemia Interactive. The game was announced at E3 2013 and released in its alpha version on 1 August of that year. It is the second installment in the Take On series after Take On Helicopters. The user assumes control of a rover or lander in order to explore Mars. The spacecraft can be equipped with scientific instruments by the player in order to study the Martian surface and complete objectives. The game includes seven destinations for the player to visit: Asteroid Belt, Deimos moon, Gale crater, Kaiser crater, Lyot crater, Ptolemaeus crater, and Victoria crater; with Mars Yard located on earth as a testing ground. Each map is a perfect square (four by four kilometers) with an area of 16km2 (6.2mi2) to be explored with various objectives. Not all locations however are encompassed in the bounding zone, since the craters on mars take up more than 16 km2 (e.g. Gale and Kaiser crater).
Players can also take on the role of an astronaut building bases, exploring the terrain and managing the resources needed to keep their crew alive. The second chapter of the space program is a story focused on the survival on Mars. Players take on the role of astronaut Mark Willis, one of the crew members in the first crewed mission to Mars. Launched from Earth in 2028, the mission reaches Mars orbit a year later. However, during the descent into Mars' atmosphere, things go wrong, and connection to Earth is lost. When contact cannot be re-established, the crew is declared MIA.
