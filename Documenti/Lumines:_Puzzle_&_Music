Descrizione: Lumines: Puzzle & Music is a puzzle game for iOS and Android, developed and published by Mobcast with Resonair as co-developer. It was the second smartphone game in the Lumines series after Lumines: Touch Fusion. The objective is to rotate and drop 2Ã—2 blocks to create squares of the same color as a vertical line sweeps across the board to erase completed squares and award points to the player. It was released in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand on July 19, 2016, and later worldwide on September 1, 2016.
Creator of the Lumines series, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, decided to work with Mobcast and Resonair after discovering the previous rights holder, Q Entertainment, had quit the video game business. Mobcast was responsible for developing the game and Resonair provided visual concepts. The game received downloadable content in the form of albums, a freemium version titled Lumines: Puzzle & Music Neo, and a lite version for Facebook. It was well-received by critics with praise focused on the touch controls, songs, and visuals while also criticizing the amount of content in the initial release of the game. Distribution of Lumines: Puzzle & Music ended on March 17, 2020.
