Titolo: Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Chibi-Robo! Park Patrol, known in Japan as Sakasete! Chibi-Robo! (咲かせて!ちびロボ!, "Make It Bloom! Little-Robo!"), is a video game for the Nintendo DS developed by Skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo. It is the second installment in the Chibi-Robo series and the sequel to the original Chibi-Robo! for the GameCube. It was released on July 5, 2007 in Japan, October 2 in North America, and March 20, 2008 in Australia. The game was never released in Europe and was a Walmart exclusive in North America.  
Chibi-Robo! Park Patrol puts the player in the role of the titular character Chibi-Robo, a four-inch-tall robot tasked with revitalizing a park. The player does so by growing seeds into flowers by watering them with a squirter and spreading more seeds by causing the flowers to dance using a tiny boombox. The player can also alter the terrain, build and repair various structures, visit the accompanying town, and defend the park from noxious Smoglings, bits of pollution which can kill flowers. 
Park Patrol received generally positive reviews, with some calling it an improvement over the original for its improved graphics, charm, minigames and music, although some gameplay mechanics were criticized. Despite selling well in Japan, it was commercially unsuccessful in North America due to its limited release. A third game in the series, Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy Richie Ōsōji!, was released on July 23, 2009 in Japan only.
