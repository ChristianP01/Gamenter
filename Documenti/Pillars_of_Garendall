Titolo: Pillars of Garendall

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Pillars of Garendall is a role-playing video game that was built by Beenox Studios and Ambrosia Software. It was built using the Coldstone game engine, which was also a joint Beenox/Ambrosia project. The game was released in 2001 for Mac OS Classic, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.Due to problems with the Coldstone game engine, which renders Pillars of Garendall unplayable on recent versions of the Mac OS X platform, Ambrosia Software stopped selling licenses for the full game and as of December 2008, the Coldstone game engine has been indicated as being "discontinued" with regard to the latest version information on the Ambrosia Software website. The new management of Beenox is uninterested in fixing these problems with the game engine. Ambrosia Software has stated that they want to fix the Coldstone software, but that they never would have agreed to distribute the project if they had known they would have to provide updates and bug fixes.
