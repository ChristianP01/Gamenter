Anno: 2018

Descrizione: The Lost Legends of Redwall (originally titled Redwall: The Adventure Game, Redwall: The Warrior Reborn, and Epic Tales of Redwall during development) is a series of six episodic indie adventure games for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Xbox One developed and published by studio Soma Games. They are the first officially licensed video games to be based on the Redwall book series since its introduction in 1986, and began production following a successful Kickstarter campaign for the Minecraft map "AbbeyCraft" in 2013.
Originally titled Redwall: The Adventure Game and later Redwall: The Warrior Reborn for much of its development, the series' working title was changed to Epic Tales of Redwall before arriving at its final branding. The games tell a new story within the Redwall universe set before and during the first book, and features characters and settings from the novel. The initial episode, "The Scout", was made available on Steam Early Access beginning December 18, 2017, with a full release on September 14, 2018. A PlayStation 4 and Xbox One release came in summer 2019 and subsequent episodes for all intended platforms are planned for distribution in the near future.
