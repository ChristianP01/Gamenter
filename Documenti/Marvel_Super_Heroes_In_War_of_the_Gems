Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Marvel Super Heroes In War of the Gems (マーヴルスーパーヒーローズ ウォーオブザジェム, Māvuru Supā Hīrōzu: Wō obu za Jemu) is a 1996 beat-'em-up platform game developed by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, based on the events of Marvel Comics' series The Infinity Gauntlet and  The Infinity War. In the game's plot, Adam Warlock calls upon Earth's greatest superheroes to seek out the Infinity Gems before they fall into the wrong hands.
Although War of the Gems is based on a similar storyline as the Capcom arcade game Marvel Super Heroes, and each of the playable characters retains one of the special moves they had in that game, it is not a port; War of the Gems instead features gameplay similar to Final Fight and X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse. In 2020, the game was rereleased as part of a home arcade cabinet from Arcade1Up alongside X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes.
