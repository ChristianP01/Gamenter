Titolo: Brett Hull Hockey

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Brett Hull Hockey is an ice hockey video game developed by Radical Entertainment and originally published by Accolade for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America on January 1994. It prominently features former Canadian-American NHL player Brett Hull and is officially licensed from the NHL Players' Association.
Featuring the sportscaster Al Michaels as the play-by-play announcer, players have the choice to play across any of the game modes available against with either CPU-controlled opponents or other players. Despite being licensed by the NHLPA, the game was not officially endorsed by the NHL and as such, all the teams are referred only by city with no use of the team name itself, in addition to not having either NHL team logos or NHL emblems to be seen anywhere in the title.
Brett Hull Hockey received mixed but positive reception when it was released. Ports for the Sega Genesis, Atari Jaguar and Atari Jaguar CD were in development but never released. A sequel to the game, Brett Hull Hockey '95, was released the following year for MS-DOS, Sega Genesis and Super NES.
