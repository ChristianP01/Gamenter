Titolo: Preppie! (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Preppie! is an action video game for the Atari 8-bit family published by Adventure International in 1982. It was programmed by Russ Wetmore, and his name is prominently displayed on the box cover. Leaning on the preppy trend of the early 1980s, the game follows prep schooler Wadsworth Overcash as he navigates the hazards of a country club to retrieve golf balls. Preppie! borrows heavily from Konami's Frogger, with lanes of traffic in the bottom half of the screen and a river at the top. Alligators are an element from both Frogger and preppy fashion; an open-mouthed gator is  the icon of shirt brand Izod. Reviewers recognized the game as derivative, but called the music and visuals some of the best for Atari 8-bit computers.
Preppie! was followed by a maze game, Preppie! II, from the same author in 1983. In January 2016, Russ Wetmore released the source code for both games.
