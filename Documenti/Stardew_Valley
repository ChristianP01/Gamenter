Titolo: Stardew Valley

Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Stardew Valley is a simulation role-playing video game developed by Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. It initially released for Microsoft Windows in February 2016 before being ported to several other computer, console, and mobile platforms. Players take the role of a character who takes over their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as Stardew Valley. The game is open-ended, allowing players to take on activities such as growing crops, raising livestock, mining and foraging, selling produce, and socializing with the townspeople, including the ability to marry and have children. It also allows up to three other players to play together online.
Barone developed Stardew Valley by himself over four years. He was heavily inspired by the Harvest Moon video game series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of those games. He used it as an exercise to improve his own programming and game design skills. British studio Chucklefish approached Barone midway through development with the offer to publish the game, allowing him to focus more on completing it. 
Stardew Valley was a critical and commercial success, selling over 15 million copies by 2021. Critics highlighted the game's music, characters, and relaxing qualities. Barone's decision to include same-sex relationships was also praised. Yasuhiro Wada, the creator of Harvest Moon, praised the game for retaining the freedom that later entries of his series had lost.
