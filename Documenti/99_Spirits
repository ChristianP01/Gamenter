By using the gems embedded in her sword, she is able to find clues to the spirits' names; players need to correctly identify the spirits to be able to harm them. By acquiring more gems, players are given access to more abilities; one such gem allows players to capture spirits and use their abilities in battle and when solving puzzles.
Reception of the game has been varied, ranging from negative to highly positive, with reviewers generally appreciating the art, sound, presentation, and inventive gameplay, while criticizing the plot, level designs, and repetition.
