Titolo: Crisis Mountain

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Crisis Mountain is a platform game written by David H. Schroeder for the Apple II and published by Synergistic Software in 1982. A port to the Atari 8-bit family was released in 1983. Creative Software published cartridge versions for the Commodore 64 and Commodore VIC-20.  Ports for the FM-7 and PC-8800 series were from Comptiq.
In Crisis Mountain, the player must defuse bombs left in a lair below a volcano which was abandoned by terrorists. One of the first games with regenerating health, the player is not always killed by an individual mishap. Health—labeled as strength—is shown as a number from 0–3, and after taking damage it slowly increases over time. Schroeder later developed Dino Eggs for the Apple II.
