Titolo: Robowarrior

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: RoboWarrior, known in Japan as Bomber King (ボンバーキング, Bonbā Kingu), is an action puzzle video game developed by Hudson Soft, and co-developed by Aicom, making it their first NES game they worked on, and published by Jaleco for the Nintendo Entertainment System and the MSX.
While often cited as a Bomberman spin-off due to being made by Hudson and having some similar base mechanics and title, the game is actually informally part of the Blaster Master series. The original MetaFight, released in 1988, borrows gameplay mechanics, powerups, enemies, and bosses from Bomber King, and those elements persist all the way through into the most recent entries in the Blaster Master series. Additionally, Hudson had no involvement in Bomber King's sequel, which was in turn localized in the West as part of the Blaster Master franchise.
