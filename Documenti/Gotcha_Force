The official Capcom Japan website showcases many pieces of concept art and videos. There is also a toy and manga line in Japan though it is extremely rare.In March 2012, Capcom reprinted copies for the GameCube in Japan 9 years after its original release, which stirred talk of a possible future sequel to come.
