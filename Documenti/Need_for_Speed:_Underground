Titolo: Need for Speed: Underground

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Need for Speed: Underground is a 2003 racing video game and the seventh installment in the Need for Speed series. It was developed by EA Black Box and published by Electronic Arts. Three different games were produced, one for consoles and Windows, and the other for the Game Boy Advance along with a version developed by Global VR for Arcades that was published by Konami. 
Underground rebooted the franchise, ignoring the previous Need for Speed games which featured sports cars and exotics. It was the first game in the series to offer a career mode featuring a storyline, and a garage mode that allowed players to fully customize their cars with a large variety of brand-name performance and visual upgrades. All races take place in a generic city at night called Olympic City, though the city bears some resemblance to New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Rather than exotic cars, Underground featured vehicles associated with the import scene. Underground was critically and commercially successful, and was followed by Need for Speed: Underground 2 in 2004.
