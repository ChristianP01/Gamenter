Titolo: Bomb Alley

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Bomb Alley is a 1983 computer wargame designed by Gary Grigsby and published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI). Covering the Mediterranean Theatre of World War II, it runs on the Apple II platform. It has the distinction of being the first true land-sea-air computer wargame, where ground troops could advance and retreat across land.
The game's main scenario is the summer of 1942 when Rommel's forces threatened to capture Cairo and Alexandria. There is also a smaller scenario covering the Battle of Crete in 1941. Bomb Alley was Grigsby's second game, following Guadalcanal Campaign (1982). It reuses that title's engine, and was coded and distributed as uncompiled Applesoft BASIC. Grigsby developed both games while working full-time for the United States Department of Defense.
Grigsby and SSI followed Bomb Alley with North Atlantic '86 (1983), made with the same engine.
