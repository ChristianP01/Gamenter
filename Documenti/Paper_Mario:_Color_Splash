Titolo: Paper Mario: Color Splash

Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Paper Mario: Color Splash is a 2016 cross-genre video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Wii U console. It is the fifth installment in the Paper Mario series, and is part of the larger Mario franchise. The story follows the protagonist Mario and Huey, on a quest to retrieve the six Big Paint Stars to save Prisma Island and rescue Princess Peach from Bowser.
The idea for a paint-themed game came from Atsushi Isano, the director for Intelligent Systems. The game was developed to take advantage of the Wii U hardware, such as the GamePad. The developing team implemented a card-based battle system to utilize the GamePad's touchscreen to sort, paint, and flick cards. The artists heavily focused on making the in-game paper textures to appear as realistic as possible. The game was released worldwide in October 2016.
Upon the game's reveal, Color Splash was met with controversy for continuing the genre format introduced in Sticker Star. On release, however, the game received generally positive reception from critics, praising the game's graphics, soundtrack and improved dialogue. The combat system and lack of character variety were also criticized. The game was followed with Paper Mario: The Origami King in 2020.
