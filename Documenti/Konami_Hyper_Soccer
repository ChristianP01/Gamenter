Descrizione: Konami Hyper Soccer is a 1992 soccer video game developed and published by Konami in Europe and Mattel in Australia for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Part of the Hyper Sports series, which included Hyper Olympic (Track & Field outside Japan), its sequel Hyper Sports and Hyper Athlete (International Track & Field outside Japan), it is the second soccer game by Konami following Konami's Soccer (Konami's Football outside Japan) on the MSX, and their first soccer game on a Nintendo platform.
Konami Hyper Soccer received mixed reception from critics at release; reviewers noted the lack of on-screen display of the game's score or time remaining during gameplay, and felt divided regarding aspect such as the audiovisual presentation and playability, while criticism was geared at its technical shortcomings but the controls, range of available options and addition of a two-player mode were commended. Some named it one of the best soccer titles on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Retrospective commentary has been more positive, and is considered the predecessor to Konami's International Superstar Soccer and Pro Evolution Soccer  franchises.
