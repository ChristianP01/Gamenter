Titolo: Road Rash II

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Road Rash II is a 1992 racing and vehicular combat game developed and published by Electronic Arts (EA) for the Sega Genesis. The game is centered around a series of motorcycle races throughout the United States that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while engaging in unarmed and armed combat to hinder the other racers. It is the second installment in the Road Rash series and introduces a split-screen two-player mode for competing human players, nitrous oxide charges on certain bikes, and chains as offensive weapons.
EA began development of Road Rash II before the end of the 1991 Christmas season, and the game was released before the end of the 1992 Christmas season. Road Rash II met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers appreciating the visuals and addition of the multiplayer mode while pointing out the lack of innovation in the fundamental gameplay. A conversion for the Game Boy Color was developed by 3d6 Games and released under the title Road Rash in 2000. The game saw additional releases on the PlayStation Portable compilation title EA Replay in 2006 and on the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019.
