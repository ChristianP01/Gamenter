Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Jeff Wayne's The War of the Worlds is a real-time strategy video game developed by Rage Software Limited and released for Windows-based PCs in 1998. It is based on Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds â€” which is itself based on H. G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of the Worlds.
In 1999, another game of the same name was released for the Sony PlayStation. The 1999 game reuses the 1998 game's graphics and music, but features entirely different gameplay: it is a real-time strategy game with a focus on vehicular combat.
The game includes remixed instrumental versions of some songs from the 1978 album. It also re-uses Richard Burton's voice recordings during the Human campaign intro and ending scenes.
