Titolo: Aiyoku no Eustia

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Aiyoku no Eustia (穢翼のユースティア, Aiyoku no Yūsutia, lit. "Eustia of the Tarnished Wings") is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by August for Windows and was released on April 28, 2011. Aiyoku no Eustia is August's eighth game, preceded by Fortune Arterial and Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na: Moonlight Cradle. It was planned to be released on March 25, but the schedule was changed due to the Great East Japan earthquake. An enhanced port for the PlayStation Vita titled Aiyoku no Eustia: Angel's Blessing was released on June 26, 2014. Two manga volumes based on Aiyoku no Eustia were published by Kadokawa Shoten. Novels, comic anthologies and drama CD's have also been released.
The title is a play on words: the actual Kanji used are ai (穢, dirty) and yoku (翼, wing), rendering the primary meaning of "Eustia of the Tarnished Wings". However, aiyoku is a homonym in Japanese, and also means "worldly passion" or "lust" (愛欲). Accordingly, the alternate reading is "Eustia of Passion", which is an allusion to events within the game.
