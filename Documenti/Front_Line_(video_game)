Titolo: Front Line (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Front Line is a military-themed run-and-gun shooter game released by Taito for arcades in 1982. It was one of the first overhead run-and-gun shooters, a precursor to many similarly-themed games of the mid-to-late 1980s. The original arcade version of Front Line is controlled with a joystick, a single button, and a rotary dial that can be pushed in like a button. The single button is used to throw grenades and to enter and exit tanks, while the rotary dial controls and fires the player's gun.
The game was created by Tetsuya Sasaki. It was a commercial success in Japan, where it was the seventh highest-grossing arcade game of 1982. However, it received a mixed critical and commercial reception in Western markets, with praise for its originality but criticism for its difficulty. The game's overhead run-and-gun formula preceded Capcom's arcade hit Commando (1985) by several years. Front Line went on to inspire the SNK shooters TNK III (1985) and Ikari Warriors (1986), which follow the conventions established by Front Line, including the vertically scrolling levels, entering/exiting tanks, and not dying when an occupied tank is destroyed.
