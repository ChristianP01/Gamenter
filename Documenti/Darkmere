Titolo: Darkmere

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Darkmere: The Nightmare's Begun is an action-adventure game developed by Zero Hour Software and published by Core Design in 1994. Darkmere was first being developed by Arcane Developments, but due to repeated delays and the project becoming too ambitious, development was moved in-house at Core Design and the code was "virtually rewritten from scratch." Core Design went on to publish a sequel to Darkmere that same year called Dragonstone, on Amiga and Amiga CD32, which failed to match the critical approval of its predecessor.
