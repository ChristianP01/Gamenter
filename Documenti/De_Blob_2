Titolo: De Blob 2

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: De Blob 2 (stylized as de bLob 2) is a platform puzzle video game and the sequel to the Wii 2008 video game De Blob. As with its predecessor, De Blob 2 was developed for home consoles by Blue Tongue Entertainment and published by THQ, this time in association with the TV network Syfy. Unlike de Blob, however, de Blob 2 was also released for other consoles other than the Wii; the game was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the Nintendo DS, with the latter version having been developed by Halfbrick Studios and taking place between de Blob and de Blob 2. This was the last game to feature the 2000 THQ logo: it appears in-game and on the Australian box art of the Nintendo DS, PS3, Nintendo Wii, and Xbox 360 versions. Oddly enough, it also appears on the digital release of the Xbox 360 version.
In 2017, THQNordic collaborated with BlitWorks to re-release de Blob 2 (as well as the first de Blob) for then-current generation platforms. Both games were released on June 22, 2017, for Microsoft Windows and in 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 27, and August 28 for Nintendo Switch.
