Titolo: Alien Brigade

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Alien Brigade is a horizontally-scrolling rail shooter released by Atari Corporation in 1990 for the Atari 7800. Similar in style to Operation Wolf, Alien Brigade tells the story of a soldier battling with alien invaders that take over the bodies of fallen soldiers. 
Despite being released late in the Atari 7800's life cycle, Atari Corporation made more efforts to market the game than it had with other Atari 7800 titles. The game had its own print advertisement and was referenced in Atari's 1990 shooter, Planet Smashers (Alien Brigade would return the favor by advertising Planet Smashers).
Alien Brigade is 144K in size, making it one of the largest commercially released Atari 7800 games.
