Titolo: F-1 (arcade game)

Anno: 1976

Descrizione: F-1 is a 1976 electro-mechanical arcade racing game developed and published by Nakamura Manufacturing Company (Namco), and distributed in North America by Atari, Inc.  The player uses a steering wheel to control a Formula One racer, which must avoid collision with other vehicles. The game uses a miniature diorama with small, plastic cars to represent the player's car and opponents on a physical, rotating track, while also featuring a projector system and lighting tricks to create the illusion of racing.
The game was designed by company engineer Sho Osugi, who worked on many of the company's earlier driving-themed electro-mechanical games, and was made to be a smaller version of his earlier game Formula-X that could easily be placed into smaller stores and entertainment centers. The 1968 electro-mechanical driving game Indy 500 by Kansai Seiki Seisakusho (Kasco) is also believed to be a source of inspiration for the game, likely due to Namco's strong business relationship with Kansai prior to development.
F-1 was widely successful upon release, being praised for its sense of thrill, responsive controls and attractive cabinet design. It is cited as the first game based on Formula One racing and one of Namco's first major arcade hits. It was the highest-grossing arcade game in Japan for two years in a row, in 1976 and 1977, and the highest-grossing electro-mechanical arcade game of 1977 in the United States. It was followed by a sequel, F-1 Mach (1977). A cabinet appears in the film Dawn of the Dead (1978). F-1 later provided the basis for Namco's hit racing video game Pole Position (1982), which was co-designed by Sho Osugi.
