Titolo: Bionic Commando Rearmed 2

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 is a run-and-gun platform game developed by Fatshark and published by Capcom. A sequel to the Bionic Commando Rearmed, it features enhancements to protagonist Rad Spencer's bionic arm, which he primarily uses to grapple to and swing from objects. New bionic enhancements include abilities such as hacking data terminals, a powerful uppercut, and firing grenades.
The game's plot revolves around a dictator named General Sabio and a missing commander from Spencer's organization, Colonel Brubaker. Spencer and a team of four other bionics are sent to locate Brubaker and his platoon and help them complete their mission of disarming Sabio's missiles. The team's original mission evolves as the bionics, split into three teams, face opposition greater than they have previously faced. Reception from critics was lukewarm. Some critics praised the new gameplay mechanics, while others felt that it was a step down from its predecessor.
