Titolo: Ancient Domains of Mystery

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Ancient Domains of Mystery is a roguelike video game designed and developed by Thomas Biskup and released in 1994. The player's goal is to stop the forces of Chaos that invade the world of Ancardia. The game has been identified as one of the "major roguelikes" by John Harris.Like the original roguelike games, Ancient Domains of Mystery uses ASCII graphics to represent the game world. A later version added the option to play with sound, tile-based graphics, and an overworld map. Most dungeons are procedurally generated, but once the game generates a dungeon, it does not change even if the player exits and re-enters it.
Biskup ceased development of the game for nine years and revisited it in 2012. He then resumed work on a sequel, Ultimate ADOM, an engine for future roguelike games. Biskup first made an updated version of Ancient Domains of Mystery available to sponsors of his crowdfunding campaign. Later versions, beginning with v1.15.2.r60, were released on the internet and through digital distribution services.
