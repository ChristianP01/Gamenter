Descrizione: Dragon Age II is an action role-playing video game developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts (EA) for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and OS X. It is the second major game in the Dragon Age series and was released worldwide in March 2011. The game features a total of six downloadable content packs that were released from November 2009 to September 2010 on Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and BioWare's website. Most of these content packs feature new quests and new locations for players to access in the base game, as well as new items for the player to make use of. Two story-focused content packs serve as standalone side stories from the base game, both of which advance the narrative of the Dragon Age series as a whole: Legacy, and Mark of the Assassin. 
In Legacy, released on July 26, 2011 to a mixed reception from reviewers, the game's protagonist Hawke investigates a prison constructed by the Grey Wardens with the assistance of their father Malcolm Hawke, which holds a powerful and ancient darkspawn. In Mark of the Assassin, released on October 11, 2011 which served as a tie-in with the webseries Dragon Age: Redemption, Hawke must help the elf spy Tallis infiltrate an Orlesian estate outside Kirkwall and steal a precious relic. Mark of the Assassin was warmly received by reviewers, who generally considered it to be the better of the two packs.
Many smaller content items in Dragon Age II were given away for promotional purposes as pre-order bonuses, platform exclusives and as rewards from participation in special events. Two of these items, Blood Dragon Armor and Ser Isaac's armor, were offered as part of crossover promotions.
