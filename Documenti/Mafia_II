Titolo: Mafia II

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Mafia II is a 2010 action-adventure game developed by 2K Czech and published by 2K Games. It was released in August for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The game is a sequel to 2002's Mafia and the second installment in the Mafia series. Set within the fictional city of Empire Bay (based on New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston and Detroit) during the mid-1940s and 1951, the story follows Vito Scaletta, a young Sicillian-American mobster and war veteran, who becomes caught in a power struggle among the city's Mafia crime families while attempting to pay back his father's debts and secure a better lifestyle.
The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. The player character's criminal activities may incite a response from law enforcement agencies, measured by a "wanted" system that governs the aggression of their response. Development began in 2003, soon after the release of the first Mafia game. At release, Mafia II received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise particularly directed at the story, gameplay and characters but the restrictive world design and lack of features from other sandbox games was criticized.
A version consisting of previous downloadable content, entitled Mafia II: Director's Cut, was released by Feral Interactive in December 2011. Mafia II was followed by the sequel Mafia III in October 2016. To coincide with the remake of 2002's Mafia, Mafia II: Definitive Edition, a remastered version of the game developed by D3T, was released by 2K Games on May 19, 2020. It received mixed reviews, particularly for its bugs and glitches, which weren't present in the original game. This Definitive Edition was also bundled in the Mafia: Trilogy pack, released on 25 September 2020.
