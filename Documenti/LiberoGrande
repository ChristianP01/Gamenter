Titolo: LiberoGrande

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: LiberoGrande is a 1997 arcade game by Namco. It was converted for the Sony PlayStation in 1998.
A typical arcade football game in its nature, LiberoGrande introduced a novelty factor previously found in Namco's Top Striker for the Nintendo Entertainment System: the ability to play as just one player, instead of controlling the whole team, always swapping for players nearer the ball. This idea was later used by Konami in Winning Eleven/Pro Evolution Soccer titles in the Become a Legend mode, and by EA Sports in its various sports game franchises with the name Be a Pro.
