It introduced what would become standard elements in the series, including the isometric on-court perspective, the "T-meter" for shooting free throws, and the turbo button used to give players a temporary burst of speed. The game's engine is a modified version of EA Sports' FIFA International Soccer engine, using the same perspective. The game was re-released with NBA Live 06 as part of the EA Retro Series. Game Players gave the Super NES version its "best sports game award" in their Super NES division on the January 1995 issue of their magazine.This was the first official NBA simulation video game to introduce customized fictional teams and copies of existing players as well as a Create-a-Player function for users to make themselves in the game. It is also notable for being the first NBA video game to not feature Charles Barkley, as he began refraining from signing licensing agreements due to the lack of pay to retired players from the NBAPA.NBA Live 95 was followed by NBA Live 96.
