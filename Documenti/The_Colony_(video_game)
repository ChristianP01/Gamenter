Titolo: The Colony (video game)

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: The Colony is a first-person shooter developed by David Alan Smith. It was published by Mindscape.
The 1988 Macintosh release came in two versions, one in color and one with black-and-white graphics. The MS-DOS version, released the same year, was available in black-and-white only. The 1990 Amiga version was in color.
Previous first-person perspective games of the era used precomputed views, such as The Sentinel, or fixed-perspective graphics, such as Phantom Slayer. The Colony was one of the first games of its kind to let the player move freely while rendering graphics in real time. It was also one of the first 3D games to let the player drive a vehicle.
