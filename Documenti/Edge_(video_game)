Titolo: Edge (video game)

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Edge is a puzzle-platform game developed by Mobigame for PC and iOS devices. The objective is to guide a rolling cube through maze-like levels and reach the goal. Originally released on the App Store in December 2008, it has been removed and re-added to the store multiple times due to a trademark dispute with Tim Langdell of Edge Games, concerning the use of the word "Edge" in the title. This had caused the game to be briefly released as Edge by Mobigame and Edgy, before ultimately returning to the App Store under its original name in January 2010. The game was released on multiple platforms including mobile phones, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS. It was released on Steam in August 2011 by publisher Two Tribes.
Edge had a positive reception among reviewers, who praised its minimalist level design and chiptune soundtrack. The game also received multiple awards including the Milthon Award for Best Mobile Game, two categories in the 5th International Gaming Award, and nominations for three Independent Games Festival categories. An expansion titled Edge Extended was released with new levels, new music, a new 3D engine, and a new computer-controlled dark cube opponent. This expansion was released separately as an independent app for iOS on August 25, 2011, and Android on January 27, 2012. Two Tribes released the expansion as downloadable content for the Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows versions of the original game and included in the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS versions of the original game.
