Titolo: Boong-Ga Boong-Ga

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Boong-Ga Boong-Ga (Korean: 붕가 붕가, Japanese: 開ウン！ケダモノ占い), also known as Spank 'em, is an arcade game developed by a South Korean company, Taff System. It is the first arcade game to simulate kancho—a popular prank in Japan where the victim is poked with two fingers in the anus whilst distracted.
The game received infamy on the internet in 2001 for a badly translated advertising flyer that promoted the game's peculiar spanking and kancho oriented gameplay. Boong-Ga Boong-Ga was reportedly designed for the Japanese market, and according to advertising material was well received at the 2000 Tokyo Game Show.
While an initial contract was made for distribution of 200 units in Japan, only 5 units were ever actually distributed.
