Players could alter the appearance of their in-game avatar as well as the properties of their weapons at the cost of some premium in-game currency.Edge of Reality has since discontinued development of the game. On Jan 23, 2018, CE-Asia (in collaboration with P-40) published the game on PlayStation 4 in several Asian countries as a paid "Premium Edition".  Other game servers were sunset on May 24, 2018, due to the inability to provide compliance with the onset of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. On September 26, 2020, Loadout Premium's servers were shut down due to inability to afford the server cost, leaving no servers of the game available, however a fan project is currently attempting to revive the game.
