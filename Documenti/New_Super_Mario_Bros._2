Descrizione: New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a 2D side-scrolling platform video game in the New Super Mario Bros. series developed by Nintendo for its Nintendo 3DS handheld video game console and was released on July 28, 2012. It is the third game in the series and is a direct sequel to the 2006 Nintendo DS game New Super Mario Bros. and a follow-up to the 2009 Wii game New Super Mario Bros. Wii (which is a follow-up to the DS game). It is the first Nintendo-published game to be released simultaneously in both downloadable and physical forms.
The game's plot is similar to its predecessors, focusing on Mario and Luigi's efforts to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings. It has a heavier emphasis on coin-collecting than other Super Mario games, with multiple unique items dedicated to producing large numbers of coins. The game features a specialized mode called "Coin Rush" that focuses exclusively on quickly completing a series of stages while collecting as many coins as possible. Additional Coin Rush stages were made available for purchase as downloadable content shortly after the game's release.
New Super Mario Bros. 2 spans nine worlds consisting of six main worlds and three special worlds. Those worlds total 85 complete levels, many of which have multiple exits to unlock more areas of the game to play and explore.
New Super Mario Bros. 2 received generally positive reviews. Critics generally praised its level design, gameplay, and graphics, but criticized its low difficulty and similarity to the earlier New Super Mario Bros. games. New Super Mario Bros. 2 is the fifth best-selling game for the Nintendo 3DS, with 13.39 million copies sold worldwide as of 30 September 2021.
A follow-up to the game and a sequel to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, titled New Super Mario Bros. U, was released as a launch title for the Wii U on November 18, 2012.
