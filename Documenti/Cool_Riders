Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Cool Riders is a 1995 racing arcade game. It is a spiritual sequel to Sega's OutRunners. It has a similar premise to OutRunners, though rather than drive cars, the player rides bikes. It also uses digitized graphics similar to Mortal Kombat.Cool Riders has only recently been emulated in the MAME emulator. This is because it was the only arcade game on the Sega H1 Board hardware, which used a unique graphics compression scheme.
