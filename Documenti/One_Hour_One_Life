Titolo: One Hour One Life

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: One Hour One Life is a 2018 survival massively multiplayer online game developed and published by Jason Rohrer. Each player lives for, at most, 60 minutes in a large, persistent world, with each minute representing a year of life. They must gather and grow food, craft tools and build societies in order to survive. The game's source code and assets are placed into the public domain, and are freely available on GitHub, with accounts being sold for access to the primary servers hosting the game. Originally available only on the website onehouronelife.com, it was later released on Steam in November 2018.
Separate from the servers hosted by Rohrer, an independently developed, unofficial fork of the game created by Dual Decade exists for iOS and Android devices, titled You Are Hope. It is almost exactly the same as the PC version, other than slightly different graphics and a different creator.
The main ideas influencing the game's design are player cooperation, sustainability and the prospect of developing a civilization. The game has had a positive reception, with critics comparing the game favorably to Don't Starve and praising its social aspects. Rohrer has stressed the continued development of the game until at least 2020.
