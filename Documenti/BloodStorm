Titolo: BloodStorm

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: BloodStorm is a 1994 arcade fighting game published by Strata and developed by Incredible Technologies. It is considered by some as a quasi-'sequel' to Time Killers.
BloodStorm was dubbed as a possible "MK-killer" in an attempt to surpass rival Midway's success with Mortal Kombat, though it did not prevail. It was the last game Strata produced before the company went out of business. Home ports for the Saturn and PlayStation were announced in early 1995, but were later cancelled.
