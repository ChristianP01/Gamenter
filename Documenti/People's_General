Titolo: People's General

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: People's General (a.k.a. Dynasty General) is a turn-based computer wargame developed by Strategic Simulations, Inc (SSI).  It was released in September 1998 in North America and Europe.  The game focuses on early 21st century warfare in Asia. People's General, or PeG as it is commonly known, followed SSI's successful 5 Star General Series of World War II war games (Panzer General, Allied General, Pacific General) and their sequel, Panzer General II (PG2).  It uses the same game dynamics as these earlier gamesâ€”turn-based movement & fighting with military units on a hex based map. PeG uses substantially the same "Living Battlefield" game engine as PG2 but features higher quality (16 bit) graphics and many new features.
