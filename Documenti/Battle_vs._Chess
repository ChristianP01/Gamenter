Titolo: Battle vs. Chess

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Battle vs. Chess is a computer simulation game of chess developed by Targem Games and Zuxxez Entertainment and published by TopWare Interactive.  Intending to target all major seventh-generation platforms as well as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, the console and computer versions were released in Europe on May 17, 2011, while the handheld versions were cancelled.The game was not initially released in the United States due to a lawsuit by Interplay Entertainment for trademark infringement due to its similarity to their title Battle Chess. The case went to trial by jury in the summer of 2012.  In 2012, the United States District Court for the Central District of California granted a default judgment in Interplay's favor after TopWare fired its attorney and was unable to locate new counsel. On November 15, 2012, the parties settled with TopWare agreeing to pay Interplay approximately $200,000, plus interest. After the lawsuit, the game was renamed Check vs. Mate to avoid the Interplay trademark and was finally released in North America on its three planned personal computer platforms, through digital distribution networks including Steam.Battle vs. Chess uses Chessbase's Fritz 10 engine to make its moves.  It has no way of setting time controls though, and on the highest level 9 can take half a day to make a single move.
