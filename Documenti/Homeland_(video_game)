Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Homeland (Japanese: ホームランド, Hepburn: hōmurando) is a role-playing video game for the GameCube developed and published by Chunsoft, and was released in Japan on April 29, 2005.
The game can be played offline in single-player mode, or online in multiplayer mode over the Internet or on a LAN. In online mode, the player can assume the role of gamemaster and create an online game for up to thirty-five other players. It is one of only four titles for the GameCube designed for online play. It is unique among these games in a number of ways. It is the only one where the GameCube itself acts as the server, rather than the player using a central server. It is also the only online GameCube game that isn't a Phantasy Star Online title, and the only one not to get a release outside Japan.
