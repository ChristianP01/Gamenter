Titolo: Rushing Beat

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Rushing Beat (ラッシング・ビート) is a trilogy of beat 'em up video games released by Jaleco for the Super Famicom.  Although all three games were released outside Japan, localization resulted in various changes to the games' storylines and gameplay. While all three titles were released under the Rushing Beat name in Japan, localized versions used three distinct titles and changed storylines and character names. In the Japanese versions, the storyline mainly revolves around two heroes, Rick Norton and Douglas Bild. The original English title refers to a rushing attack and the fact that Norton (a plainclothes detective) and Bild (a uniformed officer) are police officers working a beat. According to the Japanese storyline, the game locale's name is "Neo-Cisco", a futuristic San Francisco, California.
