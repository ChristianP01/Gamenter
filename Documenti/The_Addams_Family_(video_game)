Titolo: The Addams Family (video game)

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: The Addams Family is a platform game based on the 1991 film of the same name and developed and published by Ocean Software. It was released for home consoles such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, computer consoles such as the Amiga, and handheld consoles like the Game Boy.
The Mario-style action-adventure game has the player control Gomez Addams. His mission is to rescue other members of the Addams family from the clutches of Abigail Craven, who, alongside The Judge and the family attorney Tully Alford, is trying to seize the Addams' wealth. The player runs, jumps, and ducks throughout the mansion's many inside and outside areas, some hidden, and can freely roam the game as in open-ended titles such as The Legend of Time (1986) and Super Metroid (1994). Levels consist of horror trope enemies like skulls, ghosts, monsters and others, and bosses withhold a member of the Addams Family, making them necessary to defeat. Power-ups, extra lives, and money are also collectable. 
Ocean, a leader in the market of video game adaptations of film in the late 1980s, began development of the tie-in for The Addams Family film in April 1991, before studios switched from 20th Century Fox to Paramount Pictures. It was originally planned to be a puzzle video game released only on computer consoles. However, that changed when Ocean was called by the studio to develop a version for the SNES. The final result was that all versions, including the computer version, were platformers with the same storyline, setting and objective. The game was critically well-received for its graphics, sound, and music, but also was widely considered to be just another platform with nothing original or special.
