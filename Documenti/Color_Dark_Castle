Titolo: Color Dark Castle

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Color Dark Castle is the first computer game in the Dark Castle series developed after the rights were sold from Silicon Beach Software to Delta Tao in 1994. This game is essentially a remake of the original Dark Castle, in color. Delta Tao reported that they had to redo all the code from scratch (the original Dark Castle was written in assembly language); also, they added new rooms, a new difficulty, and an alleged "Secret Level". Since this is a remake, the sequel to it would be Beyond Dark Castle. Another color version of Dark Castle was announced in 2000, titled Return to Dark Castle. As of 2007, the game was finished by Z Sculpt Entertainment, and was made available by spring of 2008.
