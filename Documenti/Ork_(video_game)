Titolo: Ork (video game)

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Ork is a video game for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was developed by WJS Design and published by Psygnosis in 1991.
Ork is a platform game with five levels. It takes place on an alien planet called Cisskei, where the main character, an alien called Ku-Kabul, must find his way through each level. The levels are filled with puzzles to solve and enemies to kill.
Ku-Kabul is equipped with a machine gun and a jetpack. However, these must be used with care, because ammunition and fuel come in a finite supply, although replenishments can be found in some places.
Keeping with Psygnosis's tradition of including references to earlier games, the third level of Ork includes one bit where lemmings generate out of thin air, walk a few dozen metres, then jump off a cliff.
The theme music is composed by Tim Bartlett. The cover artwork for Ork is the image Behemoth's World, which was painted by Richard Clifton-Dey, and was also earlier used as the cover for Blue Öyster Cult's 1980 album Cultösaurus Erectus.
