Anno: 2021

Descrizione: Clockwork Aquario is an  action-platform video game developed by Westone and published by ININ Games for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The gameplay involves defeating waves of enemies, picking up power-ups and items, and destroying bosses across multiple stages in order to stop Dr. Hangyo from taking over the world.
Clockwork Aquario was originally intended to be the last arcade game by Westone, being developed in 1992 for Sega System 18 and push the hardware to its limits, however the increasing popularity of both 3D games and fighting games in arcades as well as poor response during location tests in 1993 led to the game's initial cancellation. In 2017, Strictly Limited Games acquired the title's rights from Sega, with ININ Games collaborating on a restoration work alongside former Westone staff members as certain elements from the project's source code were lost.
Clockwork Aquario garnered mixed reception from critics; praise was directed to the unconventional pick-up-and-throw combo-chaining system similar to Treasure titles due to the controls, colorful visuals reminiscent of the Mega Drive era, soundtrack and co-op multiplayer, but other felt mixed in regards to the gameplay, difficulty, superfluous ideas, mechanics and overall presentation, while its short length was universally criticized.
