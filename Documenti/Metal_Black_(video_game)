Titolo: Metal Black (video game)

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Metal Black is a 1991 scrolling shooter arcade video game originally developed and published by Taito. Set in the dystopian future of 2052, players assume the role of rogue pilot John Ford taking command of the CF-345 Black Fly space fighter craft to defeat the Nemesis alien race and save humanity.
Created under the working title "Project Gun Frontier 2", Metal Black was made by most of the same staff behind Gun Frontier and ran on the Taito F1 System hardware, although its actual connection with the latter title is very loose. Under the initial internal name "Darius Part 22", development began as the third entry in the Darius series before being reworked into an original game, as its atmosphere was deemed to be very dark by Taito during production phase. Though first launched in arcades, it was later ported to the Sega Saturn and has since been re-released through compilations.
Metal Black was met with mixed reception from critics since its initial arcade release and later on the Saturn as an import title. The game later served as an inspiration for G.rev's Border Down, including its "beam level" system.
