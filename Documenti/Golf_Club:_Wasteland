On September 3, 2021, it was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, after being announced at E3 2021. The game has players explore desolate ruins of the Earth that have been transformed into a golf course after an apocalyptic event kills all of humanity except for the extremely wealthy, who flee to Mars. Primarily developed by the visual artist Igor SimiÄ‡, the game follows in the footsteps of his earlier mobile games, Crisis Expert and Children's Play, in providing commentary on social issues.

The game's narrative is mainly told through its soundtrack, which presents itself as a radio show called "Radio Nostalgia from Mars" playing music and interviews of people reminiscing about life on Earth. The game has been praised for its soundtrack, narrative, and art style (depicting deserted scenes from a long-abandoned Earth), while it has been criticized for relatively simple and shallow golf gameplay.
