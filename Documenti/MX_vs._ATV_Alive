Descrizione: MX vs. ATV Alive is an off-road racing game developed by THQ Digital Studio Phoenix and published by THQ.

MX vs. ATV Alive was released on May 10, 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was the first THQ game to be launched with a new pricing model, where the game would be sold at a lower retail price than most new releases ($39.99 in the United States), but with a larger amount of paid downloadable content.  A later installment of the series, MX vs. ATV: All Out, also utilized a similar pricing model.
