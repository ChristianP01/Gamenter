Titolo: Fate of Hellas

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Fate of Hellas (Russian: Судьба Эллады) (released as Great War Nations: The Spartans in North America and Sparta II: Alexander the Great in some territories) is a real-time strategy video game for Microsoft Windows. Developed by World Forge, it was published in Russia by Russobit-M in December 2007, in Europe by JoWooD in March 2008, and in North America by DreamCatcher Interactive in May 2008. A spiritual successor to Ancient Wars: Sparta (it is often referred to as a "standalone expansion", but it is, in fact, a different game), Fate of Hellas uses the same game engine as the previous title - the Ancient Wars Engine (AWE) - and features identical gameplay. Two more World Forge games using this engine and gameplay style would follow - The Golden Horde and Age of Alexander.
The game features two campaigns. The first tells the story of the last days of Spartan military dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean (396-394 BC), as the Greek city-state attempts to establish Spartan hegemony  throughout the Peloponnese. The second depicts the wars of Alexander the Great (336-326), looking at his conquests in Persia, Egypt, and India. The campaigns feature fictional depictions of historical figures such as Agesilaus II, Cleombrotus I, Darius II, Alexander the Great, Darius III, Parmenion, Khabbabash, and Taxiles, and depict such events as the Battle of Nemea, the Battle of Coronea, the Battle of Chaeronea, the Siege of Miletus, the Battle of Issus, and the Battle of the Hydaspes.
Fate of Hellas received mainly negative reviews. Although the graphics were lauded by some critics, the game was seen as generic and was felt to be too similar to its predecessor. Critics were especially unimpressed with the AI, pathfinding, lack of combat tactics, and LAN-only multiplayer.
