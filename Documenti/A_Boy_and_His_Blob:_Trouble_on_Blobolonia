Anno: 1989

Descrizione: A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia is a 1989 video game developed by Imagineering for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The video game was published by Absolute Entertainment in North America, by Nintendo in Europe and by Jaleco in Japan. A Boy and His Blob follows an unnamed, male protagonist and his shapeshifting blob friend on their adventure to save the planet of Blobolonia from the clutches of an evil emperor.
A Boy and His Blob is a puzzle-platform game that puts the player in control of the boy; its gameplay revolves around feeding his blob companion different flavored jelly beans to alter its shape into various tools in order to overcome obstacles and traverse the game's world. A Boy and His Blob was designed and programmed by David Crane. Licensed by Nintendo in the summer of 1989, development began and was completed in an intense six-week period. Crane has described the game's overall concept of a boy accompanied by a morphing blob as unconventional and wanted to try his own hand at implementing useful tools for the player.
Critical reception for A Boy and His Blob has been mixed. Though most reviewers agreed the gameplay was original, some felt it was poorly executed. The game won the 1989 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) "Best of Show" and a 1990 Parents' Choice Award. A Boy and His Blob was followed by a sequel on the Game Boy titled The Rescue of Princess Blobette. After two failed attempts to bring the series to Nintendo's other handhelds over the years, a re-imagining of Trouble on Blobolonia was developed by WayForward Technologies and released by Majesco Entertainment on the Wii in 2009. That same year, the original NES game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console service in North America and PAL regions.
