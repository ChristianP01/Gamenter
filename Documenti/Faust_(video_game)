Titolo: Faust (video game)

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Faust, known as Seven Games of the Soul in North America, is 1999 graphic adventure game created by Arxel Tribe, Anne Carrière Multimedia and Cryo Interactive. Loosely inspired by Goethe's Faust, it tells the story of Marcellus Faust and his battle of wills with the demon Mephistopheles.
Faust began development in late 1998. Designed primarily as a cultural object rather than a game, it was Arxel Tribe's second project derived from German Romantic literature, following Ring. The team's goal was to make a unique, transgressive adventure for adults, with the episodic structure of a television series such as The Twilight Zone or The Kingdom. Arxel drew inspiration from the many interpretations of the Faust legend and sought to create its own version for modern day. Faust underwent one year of development by a team of 30 people, split between France and Slovenia, and ultimately cost £700,000. Its budget was increased by the use of music licensed from Universal, including recordings by Stan Getz and Sarah Vaughan.
Although it attracted a cult fan following, Faust was a major commercial flop.
