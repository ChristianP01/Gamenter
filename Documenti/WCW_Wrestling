Titolo: WCW Wrestling

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: WCW Wrestling (a.k.a. World Championship Wrestling) is a Nintendo Entertainment System professional wrestling video game that was originally released in Japan in 1989 under the name Super Star Pro Wrestling, with a different lineup of wrestlers. It was later released in North America in 1990 with a more familiar lineup of wrestlers.
It was the first (and, to date, only) video game based on the National Wrestling Alliance (at the time, WCW was a member of NWA). After The Road Warriors left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), WCW continued to advertise the game in their own catalogs with a mock-up cartridge showing Sting on the label, though no such copies of the game with an alternate label are known to exist or believed to have ever been manufactured. To date, the game has sold over 100,000 copies.
