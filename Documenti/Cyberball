Players on each side could play against computer opponents or head-to-head on opposing monitors for a maximum of four players. In 1989, Atari Games released a sequel to the original Cyberball in both the same large dual-monitor cabinet titled Tournament Cyberball 2072 as well as a stand-alone two-player cabinet titled Cyberball 2072. The sequel included improved game play which included refined player movements and many more offensive plays and defensive formations, and changes its setting to 2072. Also shipped in 1989 were several conversion kits to modify existing cabinets to Tournament Cyberball 2072 or the 2-player-only Cyberball 2072.
