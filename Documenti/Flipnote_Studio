Titolo: Flipnote Studio

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Flipnote Studio, originally released in Japan as Moving Memo (うごくメモ帳, Ugoku Memochō), was a free downloadable application available through the Nintendo DSi's DSiWare digital distribution service. Developed by Nintendo EAD Tokyo, Flipnote Studio allowed the user to create both word- and picture-based notes with the stylus, add sound, and put them together to create frame-by-frame flipbook-style animations. In prior English-language keynote addresses and conferences, the application was referred to as Moving Notepad by Nintendo, and was announced at E3 2009 officially as Flipnote Studio. It was released in Japan on December 24, 2008, in North America on August 12, 2009, and in Europe and Australia on August 14, 2009. 
It was also included as a preloaded program on the Nintendo DSi LL/XL and Nintendo DSi with firmware 1.4. An online service, titled Flipnote Hatena (うごメモはてな, Ugomemo Hatena) allowed users to download flipnotes created by other users and were also able to post stills from flipnotes to the sharing site Miiverse. Flipnote Studio is not available to be downloaded or transferred onto the Nintendo 3DS. As a successor, Flipnote Studio 3D, was developed specifically for the system.
The online Flipnote Hatena  (うごメモはてな Ugomemo Hatena) service officially retired on May 31, 2013. However, users were previously able to transfer the Flipnotes from their Flipnote Hatena account to the new online service provided with Flipnote Studio 3D, until the Flipnote Gallery World service was shut down on April 2, 2018. After the Nintendo DSi Shop closed on March 31, 2017, the original Flipnote Studio is no longer available for download.
