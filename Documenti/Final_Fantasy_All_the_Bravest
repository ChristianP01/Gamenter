Titolo: Final Fantasy All the Bravest

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Final Fantasy All the Bravest (Japanese: ファイナルファンタジー オール ザ ブレイベスト, Hepburn: Fainaru Fantajī ōru za bureibesuto) is a  video game in the Final Fantasy series developed by BitGroove and published by Square Enix. The game was released for iOS and Android mobile devices.
The title features gameplay, characters, locations, and art assets from many different Final Fantasy games. Gameplay focuses on expanding the number of characters players possess and unlocking all the character jobs available by defeating enemies and bosses. Players can also include up to forty characters in their parties.
The game has been met with near-universal disapproval, citing a lack of gameplay depth, no character customization, no story, and costly in-app purchases. Positives mentioned were the humorous flavor text and nostalgia for the original games from which the title draws. One of the games’ producers later stated that the title is an app, not a game, and understood that this confusion had led to disappointment by players.
