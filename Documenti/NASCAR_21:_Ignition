Anno: 2021

Descrizione: NASCAR 21: Ignition is a racing video game simulating the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series season. It was developed and published by Motorsport Games and was released on October 28, 2021, for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows via Steam, with promises of a future upgradable version for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles. The game is considered by most NASCAR fans to be the worst console release of a game based on the sport ever made. Months after its launch, which was marred by game-breaking glitches, widespread complaints of undrivable cars and broken gameplay still persevere. It is still considered “unplayable” by most who bought it.
The cover athletes are Cup drivers for each manufacturer: Chase Elliott for Chevrolet, Bubba Wallace for Toyota, and Ryan Blaney for Ford. Bill Elliott is on the cover of the Champions Edition version of the game, which released two days prior, and allows players to race as Bill himself (using a 2019-2021 Gen 6 NASCAR Cup Series Ford Mustang with his 1983 Melling paint scheme). The game was built from the ground up, development on the game started around 2019 when Motorsport Games bought 704Games and received all of their assets. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 4 using rFactor 2's physics engine.On November 11, 2021, a downloadable content (DLC) package was released featuring Darlington Raceway themed throwbacks.  Cars from the 2021 Goodyear 400 throwback round were featured, and a second NASCAR Hall of Fame member, Darrell Waltrip, was added, which like Bill Elliott in the Champions Edition, players can race as him, using a 2018–2021 Gen 6 Chevrolet Camaro with his 1992 Southern 500 winner paint scheme.Screen Rant said that the game was "chock full of bugs at launch". The game was later updated on November 18, 2021, with patch v.1.25, with fixes and additional hardware support. On December 7, 2021 the game was updated to version 1.3.0 which added more wheel support and options while fixing some minor bugs. Three days later, a "Patriotic Pack" was released which included NASCAR legend Matt Kenseth in his 2003 championship paint scheme. January 25, 2022 saw the release of another patch, which included the addition of stages and other bug fixes. Two days later, the "Playoff Pack" was added with 80+ new schemes and NASCAR legend Bobby Labonte with his Interstate Batteries paint scheme.
