Descrizione: Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV is a downloadable virtual reality (VR) simulation video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 4's PlayStation VR peripheral. The game was released on November 21, 2017. It forms part of the multimedia project surrounding the 2016 video game Final Fantasy XV. Players interact with the four main characters of Final Fantasy XV while taking part in fishing around a variety of locations.
VR-based content for Final Fantasy XV was under consideration for some time. Monster of the Deep was the first VR-based video game ever developed by Square Enix. The project's initial form was a first-person shooter add-on to the main game, with a demo being created for E3 2016 around this premise. The game was changed into a fishing simulation due to the latter's higher level of immersion. While praised for its graphics and for including characters from Final Fantasy XV, the game was often called simplistic in its gameplay and glitchy in its controls.
