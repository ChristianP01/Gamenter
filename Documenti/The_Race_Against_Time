Titolo: The Race Against Time

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: The Race Against Time is a 1988 adventure video game designed by the Oliver Twins, and developed and published by Codemasters. The player controls Sudanese runner Omar Khalifa, who has to venture to six continents to light torch bowls and raise flags to begin the 1988 Sport Aid, a sport-themed charity organization. A tie-in to the Sport Aid charity, all proceeds were donated to the campaign. The game was released for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum platforms.
The Race Against Time received a polarized reception from video game critics. The game had been expected to raise Â£1 million, but instead became a commercial failure, and Codemasters later expressed regret for their association with Sport Aid. After its release, the game had to be recalled because of Codemasters' unauthorized usage of an image of Jesse Owens on the packaging; it was replaced with a picture of Carl Lewis.
