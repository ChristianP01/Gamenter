Titolo: Battlefield Heroes

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Battlefield Heroes was a 2009 third-person shooter video game developed by DICE initially and further developed by Easy Studios, published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows. Battlefield Heroes was less demanding on computer specifications than the previous games of the series to increase the audience base. In addition, the game matched players of similar levels together for fairer play.Heroes was the first Battlefield game to be made under Electronic Arts' new "Play 4 Free" model, which saw the game released for free with revenue generated from advertising and micropayments. Advertisements appeared on the website and the 'front-end' of the game although none appeared while playing, while micropayments were able to be made for additional items to customize the appearance of players' avatars or to buy stronger weapons. Furthermore, purchasable Play 4 Free Funds (formerly known as Battlefunds) were usable for redeeming rate boosts to experience points along with other items.
Battlefield Heroes, along with other EA free-to-play titles Battlefield Play4Free, Need for Speed: World, and FIFA World, went offline on 14 July 2015.
