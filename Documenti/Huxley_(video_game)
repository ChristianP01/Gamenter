Descrizione: Huxley (Korean: 헉슬리) was a multiplayer first-person shooter computer game with persistent player characters published by Webzen Games Inc.. It was being developed for Microsoft Windows.

The second Closed Beta Test was initiated in late-July 2009 and lasted until August 12. The second test allowed many more players to test the game. During the last two days of the test a high-volume stress test was carried out on to the servers where everyone with an ijji account was permitted to play the game during test hours.
