Titolo: Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh (also known as Phantasmagoria 2) is an interactive movie point-and-click adventure game released by Sierra On-Line. The game was released in North America on November 26, 1996. Though technically a sequel to Roberta Williams' 1995 game Phantasmagoria, Puzzle of Flesh shares no connections with its predecessor in plot nor characters, as Sierra initially intended the Phantasmagoria title to be a horror anthology, with each installment of a different story and style. While not a critical or commercial success, A Puzzle of Flesh, like its predecessor, is remembered for its controversial violent and sexual content, which led the game to be heavily censored or banned outright in several European and Oceanic countries.
