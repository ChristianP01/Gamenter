Titolo: From Russia with Love (video game)

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: James Bond 007: From Russia with Love is a 2005 third-person shooter video game developed by EA Redwood Shores and published by Electronic Arts. The game is based on the 1963 film of the same name, but with several changes, including additional characters, locations, and a different villainous organisation. Additionally, it features elements of later Bond films such as the Aston Martin DB5 that debuted in Goldfinger (1964) and the jet pack from Thunderball (1965).
From Russia with Love is notable in that it is the only video game to use Sean Connery's younger likeness as James Bond and the first to include all new voice work by the actor after twenty-two years away from the role, marking his eighth and final performance as Bond across any medium before his death in 2020. From Russia with Love is also the last James Bond video game developed or published by Electronic Arts before they lost the rights to Activision in 2006.
From Russia with Love was released in late 2005, for GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. A PlayStation Portable version was released in April 2006. The game received "mixed or average" reviews according to Metacritic.
