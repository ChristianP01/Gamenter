Descrizione: Superman is an action adventure game for the Atari Video Computer System (later the Atari 2600) designed by John Dunn and published by Atari, Inc. in 1979. It was one of the first single-player games for the system and one of the earliest licensed video games, released to be a tie-in with the 1978 film of the same name. Superman was built using the prototype code for Warren Robinett's Adventure, and ended up being published before Adventure was finished. Retro Gamer credits it among action-adventure games as the "first to utilize multiple screens as playing area".
