Titolo: Caverns of Mars

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Caverns of Mars is a vertically scrolling shooter for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers. It was programmed by Greg Christensen and published by the Atari Program Exchange (APX) in 1981. Caverns of Mars became the best selling APX title of all-time and was moved into Atari, Inc.'s official product line, first on diskette and later on cartridge.
The game is a vertically scrolling variation of Konami's 1981 arcade game Scramble. In Caverns the player descends into cave and at the end must retrace their steps back to the top. Christensen wrote two less successful sequels, one of which is scrolls horizontally and is very similar to Scramble.
