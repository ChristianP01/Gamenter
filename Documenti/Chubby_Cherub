Descrizione: Chubby Cherub (known in Japan as Obake no Q-tarō: WanWan Panic (オバケのQ太郎 ワンワンパニック, Obake no Q-tarō WanWan Panikku, lit. "Q-tarō the Ghost: BowWow Panic")) is a video game by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is about a flying cupid-like character who eats food and attacks enemies with hearts.
