Descrizione: Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 22 is a 1996 fighting video game developed by Tose and published by Bandai and Infogrames for the PlayStation. Based upon Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball franchise, its gameplay is similar to the Super Butōden sub-series, consisting of one-on-one fights with a main six-button configuration, featuring special moves, as well as five playable modes. It is referred as "Ultimate Battle 22" or "UB22" by fans due to the roster of twenty two playable characters from the series.
Announced early in 1995 as part of the Super Butōden sub-series, Ultimate Battle 22 shares the same character sprites as with another Dragon Ball Z fighting game developed by Tose for the Sega Saturn called Shin Butōden. The game garnered mixed reception from European critics but negative response from North American critics; Reviewers criticized for the slow gameplay, controls, lack of story mode and visuals but some commended its large roster of 27 playable characters. The title sold approximately between 260,942 and 320,000 copies during its lifetime in Japan.
