Anno: 1989

Descrizione: TaskMaker is a role-playing video game for the Macintosh, developed by the American software company Storm Impact. Originally released in 1989, it was upgraded in 1993, featuring color graphics and compatibility with newer versions of the classic Mac OS. The player controls a protagonist who is under the mentorship of the eponymous TaskMaker, a ruler who assigns ten different quests. Completing these quests involves solving various gameplay puzzles, along with battling monsters, and the final task involves a battle against the TaskMaker himself. TaskMaker received mixed reception regarding its overall storyline and gameplay.
Storm Impact also released a sequel, The Tomb of the Taskmaker, in 1997. In this game, the protagonist has succeeded the TaskMaker in becoming ruler of the land, and is once again assigned ten different quests to retrieve magical artifacts. In the final task the player is informed that the TaskMaker has come back to life; this is revealed to be misinformation spread by a guard who then engages the player in a final battle. Although Storm Impact closed not long after the latter game's release, both have remained in distribution through the website of David Cook, one of the game's programmers.
