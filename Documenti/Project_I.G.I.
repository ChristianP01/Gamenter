Titolo: Project I.G.I.

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Project I.G.I. (released in North America as Project I.G.I.: I'm Going In) is a tactical first-person shooter video game. It was developed by Innerloop Studios and released in December 2000 by Eidos Interactive. The game received mixed reviews due to shortcomings including a poorly programmed A.I., lack of a mid-game save option, and the lack of multiplayer features. However it was praised for its sound design and graphics, thanks in part to its use of a proprietary game engine that was previously used in Innerloop's Joint Strike Fighter.
It was followed up in 2003 by I.G.I.-2: Covert Strike.
A prequel titled I.G.I. Origins was announced by publisher Toadman Interactive in 2019 and was to be released in 2022.
