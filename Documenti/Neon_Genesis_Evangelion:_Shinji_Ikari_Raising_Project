Descrizione: Neon Genesis Evangelion: Shinji Ikari Raising Project (新世紀エヴァンゲリオン 碇シンジ育成計画, Shin Seiki Evangerion: Ikari Shinji Ikusei Keikaku) is a life simulation computer game based on the anime series, Neon Genesis Evangelion. The player assumes control of both Shinji Ikari and Misato Katsuragi, the protagonists of the aforementioned anime series, to "raise" Shinji. This is done through making him complete a number of different tasks. Shinji Ikari Raising Project is the second and final entry in the Raising Project series of Evangelion games, proceeded by Neon Genesis Evangelion: Ayanami Raising Project in 2001. Both games bare a strong similarity to publisher Gainax's Princess Maker series. The game was released officially in Japanese and Korean, and has received fan translations into English and Russian. The game was written by Nobuaki Takerube, and its artwork was drawn by Kengo Yonekura and Dream Japan Co., Ltd.
A manga series of the same name, by Takahashi Osamu, was serialized in Shōnen Ace and published by Kadokawa between March 2005 and May 2016. It totaled 18 volumes in length.
Both the game and manga introduce three new female Nerv technicians: Kaede Agano (阿賀野 カエデ, Agano Kaede) (voiced by Ai Shimizu), Satsuki Ooi (大井 サツキ, Ōi Satsuki) (voiced by Maria Yamamoto), and Aoi Mogami (最上 アオイ, Mogami Aoi) (voiced by Yui Horie).
