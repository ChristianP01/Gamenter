Titolo: Drelbs

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Drelbs is a maze game written by Kelly Jones for the Atari 8-bit family and published by Synapse Software in 1983. An Apple II port by Jonathan Tifft was released the same year. A Commodore 64 version followed in 1984 implemented by Miriam Nathan and William Mandel. The core objective is to move the walls of the maze to make boxes. Some reviewers found the overall collection of elements to be eccentric and unique.
Jones later teamed with fellow Synapse designer Bill Williams on the biofeedback game suite, Relax.
