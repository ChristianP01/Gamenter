Titolo: Puyo Puyo 2

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Puyo Puyo 2 (ぷよぷよ通, Puyo Puyo Tsū) is the second installment of the Puyo Puyo games; the sequel to Puyo Puyo, made in 1994 by Compile. Compile put more thought into this game after its predecessor became successful, but never knew how much of a turnaround the game would bring.
Due to its highly acclaimed success, it became the most predominant game of the series. Though with many of its rules being experimental, the ability of Sousai (相殺, sōsai, the damage offset rule) and Rensa Sibari (連鎖縛り, rensa shibari, a custom rule that causes chains with fewer than a set number of steps to score nothing and to send no garbage) became a top hit immediately, thus creating longer matches for better gameplay. Also due to its successes, it became the most widely known multiplatform game in Japan, appearing in the Arcade, on major domestic consoles, on major handhelds, on the NEC PC-9800 series, on the PC, and on others.
The name of Puyo Puyo 2/Tsū derives from an English pun, as "tsu" (通, tsū, meaning Expert) when spoken aloud sounds similar to the English word "two". Compile used similar puns for Puyo Puyo SUN and Puyo Puyo~n.
