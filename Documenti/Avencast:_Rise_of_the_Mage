Descrizione: Avencast: Rise of the Mage is an action role-playing game for Microsoft Windows developed by ClockStone and published by Lighthouse Interactive. The game heavily borrows elements of beat 'em ups. This is apparent from the ability to cast spells by rapidly combining movement inputs with mouse buttons. Alternatively short cuts can be assigned for easy access of spells. Also the scheme of recurring Boss fights reflects this relation. The inclusion of riddles shows the connection to adventure games.
