Titolo: Metroid Dread

Anno: 2021

Descrizione: Metroid Dread is an action-adventure game developed by MercurySteam and Nintendo EPD, released on October 8, 2021, for the Nintendo Switch. Set after the events of Metroid Fusion (2002), players control bounty hunter Samus Aran as she investigates the source of a mysterious transmission on the planet ZDR. It retains the side-scrolling gameplay of previous 2D Metroid games and incorporates stealth elements.
Metroid producer Yoshio Sakamoto first conceived Dread for the Nintendo DS in the mid-2000s, but development ended due to technical limitations. Industry commentators expressed interest in a new 2D Metroid game, and listed Dread in their "most wanted" lists. After their work on Metroid: Samus Returns in 2017, Sakamoto appointed MercurySteam to develop Dread, the first original side-scrolling Metroid game since Metroid Fusion. Nintendo announced it at E3 2021.
Metroid Dread received positive reviews on release and became the fastest-selling Metroid game in Japan, the UK and the US. It won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2021. Since launch Metroid Dread has sold over 2.74 million copies making it the second best selling Metroid title in the series behind Metroid Prime.
