Titolo: Grand Knights History

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Grand Knights History is a 2011 tactical role-playing video game developed by Vanillaware and published by Marvelous Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable. Following the adventures of a mercenary group in the employ of one of three warring nations, the player engages in turn-based combat while navigating maps. The game originally featured online competitive multiplayer where chosen teams of characters fight for their nation, but this ended when servers shut down in October 2013.
Production began in 2009 following the release of Muramasa: The Demon Blade; Muramasa publisher Marvelous wanted to work with Vanillaware on a PSP title. The game was directed by Tomohiko Deguchi, and GrimGrimoire artist Kouichi Maenou designed the characters. The aim was to blend Vanillaware's artistic style with a turn-based battle system and online multiplayer, both firsts for the company. Music was handled by a team from Basiscape, a frequent collaborator with Vanillaware.
The game was released to strong sales, making a significant contribution to Marvelous's fiscal profits. It also met with positive reviews from critics. Due to Vanillaware focusing on developing Dragon's Crown, a planned localization from Xseed Games and Rising Star Games was cancelled. After leaving Vanillaware, Deguchi used his concepts from Grand Knights History to develop the 2014 video game Grand Kingdom.
