Descrizione: Caves of Fear is an unreleased interactive movie video game developed by Atari Corporation in 1995 exclusively for the Atari Jaguar CD. It served as technology demonstration of the GameFilm, a then-newly developed in-house interactive movie format conceived by former Atari Corp. employee David Schwartz during his time at the company.Set in Montevideo, Uruguay in the year 1996, players assume the role of CIA agent Jack Armstrong tasked with stopping the terrorist organization World White Order before their chemical weapon is released into the world and "purifies" all of humanity. The players interact with the demo by performing actions highlighted with text messages appearing at the bottom of the screen, along with a subliminal voice in the background that queues to their possible decisions which can affect the narrative such as the getting the main character killed, and certain actions may lead to alternative scenes and endings.
Despite Caves of Fear never being intended to be officially released into the public by Atari, a playable prototype build of the game was eventually recovered from being destroyed by Atari historian and video game collector Glenn Bruner along with a colleague. It has since been released and sold online by independent groups such as B&C Computervisions.
