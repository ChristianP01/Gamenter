Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2 (ドラゴンボール レイジングブラスト2, Doragon Bōru Reijingu Burasuto Tsū) is a video game based on the manga and anime franchise Dragon Ball and is a follow-up to the 2009 video game Dragon Ball: Raging Blast. It was developed by Spike and published by Namco Bandai under the Bandai label for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 gaming consoles in the beginning of November 2010.
The game is a 3-D fighter that allows players to play as characters within the Dragon Ball universe, either against the game's AI or another player in one of the various modes of play both on and offline. The game comes with a new remake of the 1993 OVA Dragon Ball Z Side Story: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans, now retitled Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans.
While becoming the second-best-selling game in Japan for November of its release year, the game would meet with criticism over its gameplay, controls, repetitive AI, and lack of proper story mode.
