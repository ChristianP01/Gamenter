Descrizione: Fantastic Dizzy (The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy outside Europe & Australia) is a 1991 video game developed by Codemasters. It is part of the Dizzy series. It was published on several platforms, including Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Master System, Sega Game Gear, Nintendo Entertainment System, Amiga and MS-DOS.
The game was originally intended to be released in time for Christmas in 1990, but because of a legal action between Codemasters and Nintendo over the Game Genie the title was released in April 1991, making it miss the Christmas rush it was originally slated for. Furthermore, it only sold 125,000 units instead of the expected 500,000. Despite this, the game  was awarded the 'NES Adventure Game of the Year 1991' by Game Players Magazine and given the coveted 'Parents Choice Award'. The game was kind of a greatest hits of the previously released games. Almost all of puzzles were picked up from the previous titles and mixed together as well as some of mini games were the Arkade-type games of the series.
