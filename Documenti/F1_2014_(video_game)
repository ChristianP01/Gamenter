Titolo: F1 2014 (video game)

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: F1 2014 is a racing video game based on the 2014 Formula One season developed and published by Codemasters. The game features the new turbo-hybrid cars introduced in the 2014 season, as well as the team and driver line-ups. All of the 2014 Formula One tracks are featured, including new additions like the Red Bull Ring, Hockenheimring, the brand-new Sochi Autodrom, and Bahrain in night conditions.
The game allows players to choose any team to drive for at the start of Career Mode, rather than forcing the player to start at a team lower down the grid, as in previous titles. Also unlike previous titles, the Career Mode allows players to choose from three different season lengths: seven races, 12 races or the full 19 races. The game also features a new driver evaluation test, and the Scenario Mode has been improved. The game does not feature Classic Content, a feature from the game's predecessor which allowed users to drive historic Formula One cars around historic tracks.
This was the last Formula 1 game released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and the last F1 game to be released in September/October.
The game features the initial driver line-ups from the 2014 season. Substitute drivers Will Stevens and Andr√© Lotterer were not included in the game, as they both only raced once during the 2014 season.
