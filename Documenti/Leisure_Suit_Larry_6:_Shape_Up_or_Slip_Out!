Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Leisure Suit Larry 6: Shape Up or Slip Out! is the fifth entry in the Leisure Suit Larry series of graphical adventure games published by Sierra On-Line. Originally developed for MS-DOS in 1993, an enhanced CD-ROM version was published a year later. It includes revamped graphics in SVGA resolution and voice acting, a first for the series. Both versions use an icon interface similar to other Sierra games of the time, but unlike most Sierra games, the icon bar is visible at all times. The plot continues the exploits of series protagonist Larry Laffer, who has won a free trip to a luxurious health spa populated by women. The game was re-released in 2017 on Steam with support for Windows.
