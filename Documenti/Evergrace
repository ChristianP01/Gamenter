Titolo: Evergrace

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Evergrace (エヴァーグレイス, Evāgureisu) is a 2000 Japanese action role-playing game (RPG/JRPG) developed by FromSoftware for the Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2) and published by Agetec in North America (Ubisoft and Crave Entertainment in PAL territories). The game was a launch title for the PS2 in North America.IGN gave some praise to the game for its innovations at the time, including its full use of the DualShock 2 controller's buttons and the unique "paper doll" system in which the player's avatar actually visibly wears the armor and clothing assigned to it. But the IGN review said most aspects of the game were fairly "run-of-the-mill" without being egregiously bad. GameSpot criticized the game for its dated visuals and laggy gameplay during battles. The GameSpot review said that the interesting features do not overshadow the fact that the "core gameplay is awkward and uninteresting".
