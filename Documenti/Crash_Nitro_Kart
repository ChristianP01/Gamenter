Titolo: Crash Nitro Kart

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Crash Nitro Kart is a 2003 racing video game developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Universal Interactive for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance; versions for the N-Gage and mobile phones were released in 2004. It is the second racing game in the Crash Bandicoot series after Crash Team Racing and the first game in the series to feature full motion videos. The game's story centers on the abduction of Crash Bandicoot, along with other characters in the series, by the ruthless dictator Emperor Velo XXVII. Threatening to destroy the Earth if they refuse, he forces them to race in his gigantic coliseum for the entertainment of his subjects.
Crash Nitro Kart received mixed reviews, with reviews varying from version to version. The home console version was met with generally fair reviews, which dismissed the game as a generic kart racer, but commented positively on its "power slide" mechanic. The Game Boy Advance version earned slightly better reviews than the console version, while reviews for the N-Gage version were middling, with much of the criticism going to the game's "tunnel vision". Content from the game was remastered as a part of Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled on June 21, 2019.
