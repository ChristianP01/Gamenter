Titolo: Rain World

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Rain World is a 2017 survival platform game developed by Videocult. With six years of development & published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 & Microsoft Windows in March 2017, and for Nintendo Switch in late 2018. Players assume control of the "Slugcat", an elongated felid-like creature, and are tasked with searching for the creature's relatives in a derelict and hostile world.
The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit guidance on how to survive, which was the intention of the developers, who wanted players to feel like a rat living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function.
Rain World received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but criticized its brutal difficulty, inconsistent save points, and imprecise controls. Some of these criticisms were addressed with later updates, which also added a multiplayer mode.
