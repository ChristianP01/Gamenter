Titolo: Erik the Viking (video game)

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: The Saga of Erik the Viking (popularly known as Erik the Viking) is a text-based adventure video game developed by Level 9 Computing and published by Mosaic Publishing in 1984.  The game runs on Amstrad CPC, BBC model B, Commodore 64, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum.
The game is loosely based on the 1983 award-winning children's novel of the same name by Terry Jones. A number of characters and items in the game are drawn from the novel, although the plot is completely different. Jones also directed the 1989 film Erik the Viking, which was also completely different, featuring a third plot not present in either the novel or the video game. England-based video game developer Eurocom worked for some time on an NES version of the game which was supposed to be based on the book and the film, though the game was ultimately cancelled in late 1992.
