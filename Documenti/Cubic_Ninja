Titolo: Cubic Ninja

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Cubic Ninja (Japanese: キュービックニンジャ, Hepburn: Kyūbikku Ninja) is a puzzle video game for the Nintendo 3DS. Developed by AQ Interactive and published by Ubisoft, the game requires players to use the console's accelerometer and gyroscope to manipulate the titular character through various levels on a quest to rescue a princess.The game was released to mixed reviews; although praised for its unique gameplay concept, critics panned aspects of the game's control scheme, along with its "frustrating" wired level designs and relatively short length. Despite its poor reception, Cubic Ninja received renewed notoriety in November 2014, after it was revealed that an exploit in the game's level editor would allow the 3DS to execute homebrew code.
