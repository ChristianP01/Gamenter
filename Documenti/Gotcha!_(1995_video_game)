Titolo: Gotcha! (1995 video game)

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Gotcha! is an unreleased party video game that was in development by The Dome Software Developments and originally planned to be published by Atari Corporation on a scheduled 1996 release date for the Atari Jaguar. Despite sharing a similar name, it is unrelated to Allan Alcorn's 1973 arcade game. It was also intended to be released for the PC.
In the game, players fight against each other with close-quarter or weapon attacks in an attempt of turning on all of their respective colored light bulbs to be the victor, while also managing to avoiding the dangers and havoc by the gimmicks that change the dynamic course of the matches each stage bring upon. First announced in mid-1995, the project was part of an effort by Atari Corp.'s UK division to incite independent developers to work with the Jaguar on original titles.
