Titolo: Mortal Kombat: Special Forces

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Mortal Kombat: Special Forces is a 2000 action-adventure game developed and published by Midway for the PlayStation. A spin-off of the Mortal Kombat fighting game series, it is a prequel to the original 1992 game and the first 3D spin-off. Players control Jax as he pursues criminal leader Kano and his gang.
Special Forces endured a difficult development due to series co-creator John Tobias and other staff members leaving Midway before the game was completed. The departure of Tobias led to a significant trimming of content, including the removal of Sonya Blade as a playable character. Upon release, the game was panned by critics for its poor level design and tedious gameplay.
