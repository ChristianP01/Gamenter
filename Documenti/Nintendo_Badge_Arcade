Descrizione: Nintendo Badge Arcade, known in Japan as Badge Torēru Center (バッジとれ〜るセンター, Bajji Torēru Sentā, lit. "Collectible Badge Center"), is a freemium application developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS, allowing players to customize the 3DS home menu with badges. The game launched in Japan in December 2014, and worldwide in November 2015.Gameplay consisted of playing arcade crane-like games in hopes of acquiring badges, the game's main collectable. Badges were usually themed around other Nintendo properties, and once collected could be used to apply in the 3DS' HOME Menu. In addition to being decorative, some badges had special functions to them, such as launching applications and were compatible in other software as well.
In June 2017, it was announced that updates to the service would be discontinued, although the service itself is still operational.
