Titolo: Mad Stalker: Full Metal Forth

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Mad Stalker: Full Metal Forth is a 1994 side-scrolling beat 'em up game developed by Fill-in-Cafe and published by Family Soft in Japan for the Sharp X68000. It is the fourth game to be created and released by both Fill-in-Cafe and Family Soft for the X68000 platform late into its commercial life span, after being discontinued in 1993.
Though it was initially launched for the X68000, Mad Stalker: Full Metal Forth was later ported to other home computers and consoles such as the FM Towns and PC Engine Arcade CD-ROMÂ², with each one exhibiting several changes and additions compared to the original incarnation, while all versions of the game are Japanese-exclusive. In 1997, the title was substantially remade for the PlayStation. Both the X68000 and PlayStation versions have since been re-released through download services such as Microsoft Windows and PlayStation Network respectively. A conversion for the Sega Mega Drive was in development and previewed, however it did not receive an official release to the public until Columbus Circle published it on September 2020.
Despite its late initial launch, Mad Stalker: Full Metal Forth received positive reception from critics who praised multiple aspects such as the graphics, sound design and gameplay, becoming a relatively popular title among the X68000 userbase from Fill-in-Cafe that would lead it in being nominated for a "Game of the Year" award by Japanese magazine Oh!X before ultimately losing against other titles on the system.
