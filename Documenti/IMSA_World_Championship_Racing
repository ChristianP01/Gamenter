Titolo: IMSA World Championship Racing

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: IMSA World Championship Racing is an unreleased sports prototype racing video game that was in development and planned to be published by Studio 3DO on a scheduled fall 1997 release date exclusively for the Panasonic M2. Had it been released before the launch of the console was cancelled, it would have become the first officially licensed title by the International Motor Sports Association and one of the first titles to be launched alongside the system.
In the game, players compete against other racers across multiple tracks in order to finish in first place and advance to the next course. Directed and designed by Atari veteran Ed Rotberg of Battlezone and Star Wars fame, IMSA World Championship Racing originated as a demo that was showcased at E3 1995 and spent two years in development before the launch of the M2 was aborted by Panasonic due to unwillingness in competing against other fifth generation consoles released during the period, leaving the game unpublished as a result.
Despite IMSA World Championship Racing never being officially released to the public by Studio 3DO, an ISO image of the nearly completed game was leaked online in 2010 with permission from one of the original developers of the project by a community member of the 3DO Zone forums, making it the only M2 title intended for home consoles to be made available as of date.
