Titolo: The Da Vinci Code (video game)

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: The Da Vinci Code is a 2006 adventure puzzle video game developed by The Collective and published by 2K Games for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows. Although the game was released on the same day that the film of the same name opened in theaters, it is based directly on the 2003 novel by Dan Brown rather than the film. As such, the characters in the game do not resemble nor sound like their filmic counterparts.
The Da Vinci Code received mixed reviews across all platforms. Although some critics praised the game's fidelity to its source material, the majority criticized the graphics and basic gameplay, particularly the melee combat.
