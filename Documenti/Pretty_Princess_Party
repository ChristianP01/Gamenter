Anno: 2019

Descrizione: Pretty Princess Party is a 2019 simulation video game for the Nintendo Switch developed by Nippon Columbia. In the game, players create and control a princess character who serves as the stand-in for the player, with activities including decorating the rooms in a castle, dress-up, and six different minigames. The minigames can be played on one's own against computer-controlled opponents or in a multiplayer mode for up to four players.
The game saw generally positive reviews; critics liked its accessibility for child players, while still considering it appealing for adult players as well due to the castle customization and the adjustable difficulty for the minigames.
