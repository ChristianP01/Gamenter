Titolo: Omega Fighter

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Omega Fighter is a vertical scrolling shooter developed for the arcades by UPL and released in 1989. While similar to most other scrolling shooters, Omega Fighter was unique in its gameplay, level and enemy focus: rather than flying over multiple levels, the player faced up against an enormous space battle cruiser which contained every level. A Sega Genesis version was planned but never released.
