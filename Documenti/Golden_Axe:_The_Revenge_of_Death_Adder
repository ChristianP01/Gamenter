Titolo: Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder is an arcade game released by Sega in 1992. It is the sequel to the original Golden Axe and features the same hack and slash action as its predecessor with new additions and improvements. Powered by the System 32 arcade board, Revenge of Death Adder features more detailed graphics, adds new selectable characters and doubles the maximum number of simultaneous players from two to four. None of the three characters from the previous game are playable, with players choosing from four new protagonists who battle through various levels to defeat the villainous Death Adder.
While the original Golden Axe saw release on various home platforms, Revenge of Death Adder remained an arcade exclusive. Instead Sega published a completely different game, Golden Axe 2, for the Sega Genesis. Revenge of Death Adder was not officially released for the home until 2020, when it was paired with the first Golden Axe on both the Astro City Mini and Arcade1Up's smaller scale recreation of the original arcade cabinet.
