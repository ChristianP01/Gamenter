Titolo: Rescue at Rigel

Anno: 1980

Descrizione: Rescue at Rigel is a 1980 science fiction role-playing video game written and published by Automated Simulations (later known as Epyx). It is based on a modified version of their Temple of Apshai game engine, which was used for most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (as a self-booting disk), TRS-80, Commodore PET, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family.
The game requires the player to search out a space fortress looking for ten hostages. Presented in a top-down view, the player can only see the area immediately around them, so the entire base has to be searched room by room. There is a 60-minute time limit on the mission.
Rescue at Rigel was followed by Star Warrior, and the two rebranded to be part of their "Starquest" series.
