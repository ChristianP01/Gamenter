Titolo: The Shattered Alliance

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Chronicles of Osgorth: The Shattered Alliance is a 1981 computer wargame published by Strategic Simulations in January 1982 for the Apple II and Atari 8-bit family. Programmed by John Lyon, it relies on a new game engine, called RapidFire, intended to make faster and easier access to wargames published by the studio. During a turn, the program selects the units each in turn and the player only has to order them to move, attack or cast a spell. The order is then executed immediately before the program selects another unit. The game offers two categories of scenarios. The first is composed of medieval-fantasy confrontation, including a free adaptation of the Battle of Gondor against the Mordor forces in the Lord of the Rings. The second is composed of historical battles of antiquity.
On its release, The Shattered Alliance was hailed by the trade press, which praised its graphics and its new game engine, which made it quick and easy to handle. Retrospectively, the French magazine Jeux et Strat√©gie described it as a very big game by explaining that it is no coincidence that it has held the top of the bill for several years.
