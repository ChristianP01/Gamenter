Titolo: Dandy (video game)

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Dandy (later Dandy Dungeon) is a dungeon crawl maze game for the Atari 8-bit family published by the Atari Program Exchange in 1983. It was written by John Howard Palevich, originally for his undergraduate thesis while at MIT, drawing inspiration from Dungeons & Dragons, Defender, and arcade maze games. Dandy is one of the first video games with four-player, simultaneous cooperative play. It was the direct inspiration for the popular 1985 Atari Games coin-op, Gauntlet, and later turned into the Dark Chambers home game published by Atari Corporation.
In 1986, Electric Dreams Software, having failed to secure the Gauntlet licence acquired the rights to produce the home computer ports of the game. Their intention to release their game as Dauntless led to a dispute with U.S. Gold who were publishing the computer versions of Gauntlet at the same time. Electric Dreams published the game, as Dandy, for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC.The name Dandy is a play on D&D, the common abbreviation for Dungeons & Dragons.
