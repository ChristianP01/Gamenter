Titolo: EyeToy: Kinetic

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: EyeToy: Kinetic is an exercise program, or exergaming title developed in collaboration with Nike Motionworks. It has been designed to help the player improve their fitness and health using a variety of exercise games.
The game includes a wide angle "Full Vision Lens" attachment that fits over the Eye Toy lens. Without it, the player's image on the screen is too large to play this game properly. It is held in a foam insert in the standard memory card holder in the disc case. The lens attachment is not sold separately, so if it is broken or lost then the only recourse is to repurchase the entire game.
The game's sequel is titled EyeToy: Kinetic Combat.
