Descrizione: Mass Destruction is a 1997 third-person action game developed by NMS Software Ltd. and published by ASC Games and BMG Interactive. Released for the Sega Saturn, MS-DOS, and the PlayStation, the game puts players in control of a tank, and tasks them with destroying enemy forces. It has often been likened to Return Fire.The MS-DOS version was developed first, with the console versions following later. BMG Interactive initially stated that the game would be retitled "Tank" for its European release, but the game ultimately retained its original title of Mass Destruction on all releases. BMG closed down its U.S. operations shortly before the game was to be released, and subsequently sold the U.S. publication rights for Mass Destruction to ASC Games.
