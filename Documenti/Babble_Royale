Titolo: Babble Royale

Anno: 2021

Descrizione: Babble Royale is a free-to-play battle royale video game developed by designers James Lantz and Frank Lantz of Everybody House Games. It was released for Windows and macOS in early access on December 15, 2021, via Steam. In each match, up to 16 players land on a gridded board, starting as one tile, and form English-language words similarly to the board game Scrabble. Players can eliminate each other by connecting their words to opponents, and a "hot zone" closes in to shrink the board, dealing damage to players within.
