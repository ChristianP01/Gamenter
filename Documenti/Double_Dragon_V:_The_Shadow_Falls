Titolo: Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is a fighting game developed by Leland Interactive Media and published by Tradewest for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in 1994. It was later released for the Atari Jaguar by Telegames the following year. It's an American-produced sequel to the Double Dragon series by Technōs Japan, who had little to no credited involvement in the development of the game outside of licensing the IP to the publisher outside Japan.
Unlike previous games in the series, which were side-scrolling beat 'em ups, Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is a head-to-head fighting game based on the Double Dragon animated series in the style of Capcom's 1991 arcade-hit Street Fighter II, though Technōs would eventually produce their own fighting game based on the 1994 live-action Double Dragon film the following year simply titled Double Dragon for the Neo Geo.
Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls received mixed reception since it was released for the SNES and Genesis. Critics felt it was a respectable clone of Street Fighter II and gave positive comments in regards to the graphics and the sprite quality. However, the Jaguar version received negative reception from reviewers, who felt that the port did not improve upon the graphics and audio from the 16-bit versions and was also criticized for its controls layout.
The title comes from the first episode of the 1993 TV series.
