Titolo: Marvel vs. Capcom Origins

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Marvel vs. Capcom Origins is a crossover fighting video game developed by Iron Galaxy Studios and published by Capcom. It is a compilation of Marvel Super Heroes and Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes. The dual pack was released through the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in September and October 2012, respectively.
The game, which was developed using Marvel Super Heroes' and Clash of Super Heroes' arcade ROMs, aimed to maintain the integrity of their original releases. As such, no changes were made to gameplay mechanics or character balance. Origins introduces high-definition visuals with multiple options for filters and viewing angles. It implements GGPO-enhanced online multiplayer with player lobbies, spectating, and replay saving. It also incorporates a challenge system that awards points used to unlock concept art, secret characters, and other content.
Origins was met with mixed to positive reviews upon release. Critics praised the game for remaining faithful to the arcade versions and its additional features but criticized it for its outdated gameplay and unbalanced rosters. In December 2014, the game was removed from its online platforms after Capcom's licensing contracts with Marvel Comics expired.
