Titolo: Nemesis 2 (MSX)

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Nemesis 2 (グラディウス2, Guradiusu Tsū, Gradius 2)  is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up video game released for the MSX computer in 1987 by Konami. The game is a sequel to Nemesis, the MSX version of Gradius, but is unrelated to the arcade game Gradius II (which used the Roman numeral 'II'). This version was ported to the X68000 computer under the name Nemesis '90 Kai (ネメシス'90改, Nemeshisu ninetī kai), with some graphical and aural enhancements.
In a departure from other games, instead of controlling Vic Viper, the available ship is called Metalion. Unlike other titles, this game has a heavier focus on story, which is told by cut-scenes. The gameplay is mostly unchanged from the rest of the series, though there are some powerups that temporally gives the ship some enhancements. Also, when the bosses are being defeated, if the Metalion flies where they are, a mini-level can be accessed in order to obtain new permanent upgrades, if the mini levels are successfully cleared.
