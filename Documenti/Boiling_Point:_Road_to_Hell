Titolo: Boiling Point: Road to Hell

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Boiling Point: Road to Hell (Xenus: Точка кипения, Xenus: Boiling Point) is a video game developed by the Ukrainian game studio Deep Shadows and published in 2005 by Atari. Boiling Point's gameplay is a combination of open world, FPS, and role-playing video game mechanics.  Critical response upon its release was, with few exceptions, lukewarm.  This was attributed to the many technical issues that plagued the game's release: bugs, glitches and choppy performance.  Patches have been released that address many, but not all, of these deficiencies. Deep Shadows released a successor in 2009 called White Gold: War In Paradise, and another game with the same engine called The Precursors.
