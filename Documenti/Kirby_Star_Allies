Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Kirby Star Allies is a 2018 platform video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. The sixteenth mainline installment in the Kirby series, the player controls Kirby in his quest to prevent a priest named Hyness from reviving a dark force to destroy the universe. Kirby must complete each level by jumping, inhaling enemies, and using his array of abilities to progress.
Development of the game began during the 25th anniversary of the Kirby series. The developers later added additional content for the game for the sake of adding more references from past games in the franchise. The game also features more emphasis on higher definition graphics by making the screen more spread out.
Star Allies initially received mixed reviews, with praise directed towards the game's graphics, mechanics and soundtrack, and criticism directed toward its lack of depth and low level of difficulty. General reception was later re-evaluated as positive after free additional content was later added, being praised for adding a new layer of difficulty. The game has sold 3.15 million copies as of June 2020, making it one of the best-selling games on the Switch, and the highest-selling entry in the series since its debut with Kirby's Dream Land.
