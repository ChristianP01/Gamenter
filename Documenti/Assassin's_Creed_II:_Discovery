Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Assassin's Creed II: Discovery is a 2009 action-adventure side-scrolling video game developed by Griptonite Games and published by Ubisoft. It was released for the Nintendo DS in November 2009, and for the iOS operating system in January 2010. Part of the Assassin's Creed series, it is a spin-off to Assassin's Creed II (also released in November 2009) and takes place during that game's events, between Sequences 12 and 13. The game begins in 1491, and follows Ezio Auditore da Firenze's search for the Apple of Eden, which leads him to clash with the Templar Order in Spain during the Inquisition.
The game was announced on September 9, 2009, when producer Ben Mattes officially revealed that it was in development during Apple Inc.'s keynote speech; a release date was given for November 17. The iOS version was later delayed to January 7, 2010 but Ubisoft did not comment with a reason for the delay. Assassin's Creed II: Discovery received generally positive reviews from critics, and was seen as an improvement over the previous spin-off in the series, Assassin's Creed: Alta√Ør's Chronicles. The iOS version of the game was removed from the App Store in 2013. It was followed by Assassin's Creed III: Liberation (a spin-off to Assassin's Creed III) in 2012.
