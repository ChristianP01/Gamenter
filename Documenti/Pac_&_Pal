Titolo: Pac & Pal

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Pac & Pal is a 1983 maze chase arcade game developed and published by Namco. It is part of the company's Pac-Man series, is the third to have been produced in-house. Players control Pac-Man as he must eat the items in an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts that pursue him. Pac-Man is assisted by a green-colored creature named Miru, the titular "Pal", who brings the items back to the center box. Pac-Man can also collect power-ups that allow him to briefly stun the ghosts.
Pac & Pal is largely based on Super Pac-Man, Namco's attempt at making a follow-up to the original Pac-Man. When Super Pac-Man proved to be unsuccessful, Pac & Pal was created to refine many of its mechanics and build on its concept. The game was intended to be released in North America by Midway Games under the name Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp, which replaced Miru with Pac-Man's dog from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. Chomp Chomp was never released in America, and was limited to a run of 300 machines produced for several European countries. Pac & Pal was a commercial failure and remained obscure for many years. Retrospectively, it has received attention for its premise and differences compared to its predecessors, and has been listed among the strangest games in the Pac-Man franchise. It is included in several Namco compilations for various platforms.
