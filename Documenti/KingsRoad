Descrizione: KingsRoad is a browser-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game made by American studio Rumble Entertainment.
The story line of the game is similar to a fairy tale. In the absence of the king, a kingdom was captured by some evil enemies. As warrior for the King, players band together and fight enemies in order to free the princess. The game has 3D-style graphics that use Flash Player. When you have finished the main quest of the game, you will unlock dungeon mode. In dungeon mode, you face short levels and can get powerful set items. Also, every 2 weeks there's an event, and to participate in the bronze grade (first grade of the 4 grades) you need a power level of 1100 points. In events, you can get some of the most powerful items in the whole game.
