Titolo: Priston Tale

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: PristonTale is a 3D fantasy MMORPG that centers on action-based role-playing. It was originally released in South Korea by Yedang Online in 2001. It was created by Triglow Pictures Inc. (later Priston Inc.) and has since been published for Japan, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Brazil and the Spanish-speaking countries. In 2004, the English version of PristonTale went out of public beta (in which it had remained for nearly two years) and became a commercial pay-to-play game. On May 17, 2007, PristonTale announced free-to-play service for everyone; instead of paying for the game, PristonTale has a cash shop in which players can pay real money for game items. On September 30, 2008, the English server for Priston Tale closed; Suba Games opened a new English server three days later. There are more players in the private servers.
Some of the features of PristonTale include a clan system, in-game shops, ten character classes – all of which can use every item available if they have the correct upgraded statistics (with the exception of armour, robes, and orbs) – a five-tiered skill system for each class, item upgrades, a simple yet involving battle system and an easy to use interface. PristonTale is also intensive in potion using, and dying is moderately easy. The experience loss per death also tends to climb quite steeply (experience loss is based on a percentage of obtained experience), mirroring the ever increasing experience needed to level.
