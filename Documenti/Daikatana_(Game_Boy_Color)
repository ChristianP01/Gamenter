Titolo: Daikatana (Game Boy Color)

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Daikatana is a 2000 action-adventure game developed by Will and published by Kemco for the Game Boy Color. It is based on the first-person shooter of the same name, which was released earlier in 2000. Players control a swordsmaster who travels through various time periods in an effort to obtain the eponymous Daikatana, a powerful sword tied to the fate of the world.
Developed separately from the original game, the Game Boy Color version of Daikatana was designed as an adventure game at the request of creator John Romero. It was released in Europe in September 2000 and in Japan as a download for the Nintendo Power peripheral in May 2001; a planned North American release was cancelled due to the original version's negative reputation. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics regarding it as superior to the original Daikatana.
