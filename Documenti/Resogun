In Resogun the player battles enemies and rescues trapped humans in a cylindrical, voxel-based world.

The game was criticized for its short length and lack of tutorials or explanations for several gameplay elements. Resogun won several awards, and was nominated for Action Game of the Year at the 2014 DICE Awards, and also appeared at the 2014 GDC Choice Awards.
