Titolo: Rip Off (video game)

Anno: 1980

Descrizione: Rip Off is a multidirectional shooter with black and white vector graphics written by Tim Skelly and released in arcades by Cinematronics in 1980. It was the first shooter with cooperative gameplay and the first game to exhibit flocking behavior. Rip Off was ported to the Vectrex home system in 1982.
The objective of Rip Off is to prevent computer-controlled enemies from stealing eight canisters set in the center of the screen.  One or two players control tank-like vehicles while game-controlled "pirate" tanks rush onto the field and attempt to drag the canisters off the edge of the screen.  Enemies can be defeated by shooting or colliding with them.  The game speed and difficulty increase with each successive wave until all the canisters have been taken ("ripped off").
