Titolo: Kye (video game)

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Kye is a real-time puzzle game with a variety of interacting objects. It takes ideas from puzzle games like Sokoban and Boulder Dash, but the inclusion of active objects gives it a real-time component, and it can also produce arcade-game levels like those found in Pac-Man. Anyone can create new levels for the game.
Kye was created by Colin Garbutt of Towednack and first released in 1992. Starting with version 2.0, the game became charity shareware â€“ registration required a donation to Save the Children, and the donor received the latest version and 20 additional levels in return. As time passed, roughly 500 additional levels from various developers and designers would be added to the registered package; they could also opened in the unregistered version.
The Kye is also the object controlled by the player in the game, from which the game takes its name. This was the name of Garbutt's dog, according to the help file.
