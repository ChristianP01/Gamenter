Titolo: Gem Tower Defense

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Gem Tower Defense is a tower defense video game created by Bryan K. It was released on February 18, 2007, under the tower defense subsection of Blizzard's Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne minigames. Several game clients, Flash browser game websites and mobile devices have hosted variants of the game. The game is based upon strategy, mazing, decision making and chance. The goal of the game is to eliminate computer-controlled enemies that follow a set path to reach the end of a pathway. "Gems" are structures players build to defend their maze. Each Gem is randomly distributed leaving it to chance for a player to acquire the one needed. Gems are placed to form a maze for extending the length each enemy unit travels thereby increasing the attack time of the Gems. Both the type and quality of the Gems selected determine the damage and use of the structure.
