Titolo: Fault Milestone Two

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Fault Milestone Two is a visual novel developed by Alice in Dissonance and published by Sekai Project for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. It is the second entry in the Fault series, and is set immediately after the events of Fault Milestone One. The game features no player choices, and follows the characters of Selphine and Ritona, who were transported across the world following an attack on their kingdom of Rughzenhaide. Together, with their newfound friend Rune, the game follows their attempt to return to Rughzenhaide to confront the forces that lead the attack.
The game is written and directed by Munisix, with artwork by Hare Konatsu. It was originally intended to be released as a single game, but was split into two episodes due to its length and how the developers did not want to raise its price to match. The first episode, Side: Above, was released in 2015, while the second, Side: Below, is in development. The episodes are designed to fit around the prequel game Fault: Silence the Pedant, which is under development. According to Munisix, the first episode was a commercial success.
