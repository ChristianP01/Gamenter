Descrizione: The Cliffhanger: Edward Randy, also known as simply Edward Randy, is a 1990 action video game developed and released by Data East for arcades worldwide in 1990. Set during the 1930s in a European region, where an elderly scientist escapes from a Nazi-like army under the leadership of general "Dark Ogre" after being manipulated for his research on a secret mass destruction weapon, players assume the role of Edward Randy on an adventure to rescue the scientist's granddaughter Charlotte, who holds a prism stone that is a key piece for the enemy. Headed by Terra Diver producer Minoru Sano, the game was created by most of the same team that would later work on several projects at Data East. It was influenced films such as Indiana Jones as well as manga and anime such as Lupin the Third.
The title was met with mostly positive reception from critics and players alike, earning awards from Gamest magazine, but it did not sell enough units during its run worldwide. Conversions for multiple systems were planned but never released. The rights to the title are currently owned by G-Mode.
