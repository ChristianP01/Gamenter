Titolo: Dragonriders of Pern (video game)

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Dragonriders of Pern is a 1983 video game published by Epyx that is based on Anne McCaffrey's book series of the same name. The game was released for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64.
The player acts as the ruler of a "weyr", a mountaintop redoubt where the people of the planet Pern raise dragons in order to protect against periodic invasions of deadly "thread" that falls from a nearby planet. The game is primarily a strategic one, in which the user attempts to form alliances, but it also includes an action portion where the player controls a dragon in an attempt to destroy falling thread.
The game was considered a forerunner of similar games based on novels. A sequel for the Commodore 64, Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern, was cancelled and not completed.
