Titolo: Hoi (video game)

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Hoi is a 1992 platform video game developed by Team Hoi and published by Hollyware Entertainment in North America and Software Business in Europe for the Amiga. In the game, players assume the role of the titular lime green "Saur" character venturing into the "Madlands", an area within Hoi's home planet populated with obstacles, in order to face a ritual test of maturity and find a female partner.
Hoi was developed by Team Hoi (previously Soft Eyes), a group of young Dutch game developers who previously worked on the shoot 'em up Venom Wing for the Amiga. The project was conceived in 1990 during a gathering at the house of artist Metin Seven, who was playing with Deluxe Paint and drew a green character that would become the protagonist of their next release, as the team were determined to create their "pi√®ce de resistance" and settled with a cute platform game, with work beginning in autumn of 1990. Despite being initially let down by publisher Innerprise Software, the title was eventually released by Hollyware Entertainment (formerly MicroIllusions) and Software Business. However, Team Hoi did not receive much money from their contract with Hollyware and decided to release a special freeware remix version for the AGA Amiga system range in 1993.
Hoi received mostly favourable reception from the Amiga gaming press. Critics praised the audiovisual presentation, gameplay, character animations and puzzle-like elements but some felt mixed in regards to the controls while others criticized its idea, level design, forced memorization approach and collision detection.
