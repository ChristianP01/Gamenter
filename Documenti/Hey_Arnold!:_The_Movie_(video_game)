Titolo: Hey Arnold!: The Movie (video game)

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Hey Arnold!: The Movie is a 2002 platform video game developed by Altron and published by THQ, based upon the TV show's film released the same year. It is the only video game to be exclusively based on Hey Arnold!.
The boxart of the game is the same artwork to the theatrical poster of the film, the only difference is that the theatrical poster had its background in a grayscale or black and white color scheme with Scheck blending in with the color on top while Arnold and the gang was in color. Strangely, Scheck is omitted from the game's colored boxart.
