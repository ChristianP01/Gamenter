Titolo: Dance Dance Revolution Freedom

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Dance Dance Revolution Freedom was a rhythm game by Konami originally made available for the iOS, as part of the company's Dance Dance Revolution series of music video games.  The game was made available via Apple's App Store only in North America on February 11, 2011. The game is the second one in its series to be made available for the platform. It has since been pulled from the App Store for reasons unknown, but one factor may have been the poor syncing in the song's charts and the notoriety of the song's charts being poorly made that lead to it being withdrawn a month after release. Naoki Maeda stated he was unaware of its existence until after it was released, indicating it was released without guidance from Konami Japan.
