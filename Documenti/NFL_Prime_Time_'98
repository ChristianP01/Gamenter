Titolo: NFL Prime Time '98

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: NFL 98 (also known as NFL Prime Time 98) is a sports video game released for the Sega Genesis in 1997. Based on the National Football League, the game was a follow up to Sega's only football video game for the Sega Saturn, NFL '97. It is the last game in Sega's original Joe Montana/NFL series, which would be succeeded by NFL 2K.
Like Sega's previous two NFL releases (NFL '95 and NFL '97), NFL '98 was released exclusively for the North American market. It was not only the last American football video game for the Sega Genesis, but it was one of the last sports games released for a 16-bit console. The game runs under a modified engine of Prime Time NFL starring Deion Sanders with updated 96-97 rosters.
The July following the game's release, Joe Montana filed a $5 million lawsuit against Sega, claiming that Sega breached his license agreement in regard to the game.
