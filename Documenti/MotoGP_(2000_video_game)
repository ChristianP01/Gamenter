Titolo: MotoGP (2000 video game)

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: MotoGP is the first of Namco's 5 game series for PlayStation, with 1 to 4 on PS2 and 5 'MotoGP' on PSP. It is based on the arcade game 500GP. There is no mention of what season it represents (if any) on the box but by the inclusion of the Muz 500 bike and the Paul Ricard track it can be deduced that at least contains some of the 1999 season - albeit with a much reduced bike/team/rider/track list. Later games in the series went on to fill out the gaps and became more of a true representation of the season/s they covered. This first installment is also notable for the inclusion of Klonoa, a character from another series Namco made, appears as a special playable guest character.
