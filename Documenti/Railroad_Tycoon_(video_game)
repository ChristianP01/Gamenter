Titolo: Railroad Tycoon (video game)

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon is a business simulation designed by Sid Meier. The game is the first in the Railroad Tycoon series.
An expanded version of the game titled Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon Deluxe, was released in 1993. A port of the game for the Super NES was planned for a 1994 release, and screenshots were shown in the March 1993 issue of Nintendo Power; however the port was never released. Though no reason was officially given, it may have been due to the DOS release of Transport Tycoon, and its planned release on the then-upcoming PlayStation console. Likewise, a Sega Mega Drive version was also planned but never released. The DOS version of the game was released as freeware for download in 2006.
