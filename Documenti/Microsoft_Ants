Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Microsoft Ants was a free multiplayer strategy game for 2â€“4 players on the Microsoft Gaming Zone. The objective of the game is to get the most points by eating or stealing food, and making use of the various powerups available. Each player begins at a nest with a pre-programmed number of ants, whose goal is to scurry around the gamefield and bring back to their home nest various pieces of food such as candy, cookies, twinkies, etc. with each piece worth 15-30 points. When time runs out, the highest point score wins. On January 31, 2006, Microsoft's Zone retired Ants because of the lack of players.
