Descrizione: Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space, known in Japan as Mobile Suit Gundam: Meguriai Sora, is a third-person shooter action video game for the PlayStation 2 released in 2003. The game is centered on space based mobile suit (or mecha) combat. The game is based on the Universal Century timeline of the popular Gundam franchise.
Rather than tell a single continuous story, the single-player game in Encounters in Space is broken up into a few short vignettes that take place over the course of four years. These vignettes are accounts of several significant battles during and after the One Year War between the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon.
