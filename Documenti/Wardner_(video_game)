Descrizione: Wardner is a side-scrolling platform game developed by Toaplan and published in arcades worldwide by Taito in 1987.In Wardner, players assume the role of a child named Dover on a journey to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend Mia from the titular warlock. Initially released for the arcades, the title was later ported to other platforms by different third-party developers including the Famicom Disk System and Sega Genesis, with each one featuring several changes and additions compared to the original version. Conversions for both the Nintendo Entertainment System and PC Engine were also in development but never released.

As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.
