Anno: 2021

Descrizione: Balan Wonderworld is a 2021 platform game co-developed by Arzest and Balan Company and published by Square Enix. Assuming the role of two children guided by a magical being called Balan, the player explores twelve worlds themed after the hearts of troubled individuals. Gameplay follows the protagonists as they explore sandbox levels, collecting items to progress to further areas and using a variety of powers unlocked using themed costumes.
Balan Wonderworld is the debut project of Balan Company, a subsidiary of Square Enix led by Sonic the Hedgehog and Nights into Dreams creator Yuji Naka. Development began in 2018 as Naka's first collaboration with artist Naoto Ohshima since Sonic Adventure (1998). The aesthetic was based on musical theater, and Naka studied the hero's journey when creating the story draft. The scenario was written by novelist Soushi Kawasaki. The music, composed by Ryo Yamazaki and Hironori Anazawa, emulates musical scores and includes vocals from West End performers such as Laura Pitt-Pulford. The CGI cutscenes were created by Visual Works.
Balan Wonderworld was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 26 March. Square Enix also published a novelization by Kawasaki to coincide with its release. The game received generally negative reviews and underperformed commercially. Critics panned its gameplay and design, although there was some praise for its graphics and music. Following the game's release, Naka resigned from Square Enix.
