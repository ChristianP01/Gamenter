Titolo: Deja Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Deja Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas is a point-and-click adventure game, the sequel to Deja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True, set in the world of 1940s hardboiled detective novels and movies. It was the last game made in the MacVenture series.
An NES version was advertised in an issue of Nintendo Power, but the game was cancelled mid-development, possibly due to the game being released after the NES's lifespan. However, the game was released for the Game Boy Color as part of Deja Vu I & II: The Casebooks of Ace Harding. Like its predecessor, elements were censored, such as replacing the game over screen depicting the Grim Reaper with a gun with a gravestone. However, some scenes, including the ending, were expanded upon with more detail.
