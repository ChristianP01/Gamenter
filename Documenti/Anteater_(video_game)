Titolo: Anteater (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Anteater (The Anteater in Britain, Ameisenbär in Germany) is an arcade video game designed by Chris Oberth and released in 1982 by Tago Electronics. The player steers the tongue of the eponymous creature through a maze, retracting it when dangers approach. Though the arcade game was not a hit, it spawned a number of direct clones for home computers; Sierra’s Oils Well became better known than the original. Oberth wrote an Apple II version of his own game for Datamost using a different title.
