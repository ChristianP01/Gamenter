Titolo: Recca

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Recca is a 1992 scrolling shooter video game developed by KID and published by Naxat Soft for the Family Computer. Controlling the titular space fighter craft, the player is sent to counterattack an invading alien armada while avoiding collision with their projectiles and other obstacles. The ship has a powerful bomb at its disposal that can be used as shield and clear the screen of enemies and bullets when fully charged.
Known for pushing the Famicom hardware to the limits with its uncompromising high number of sprites and speed, Recca was created for a shooting game competition hosted by Naxat Soft called "Summer Carnival", which took place on July 17, 1992 and featured alongside the PC Engine CD-ROMÂ² shooter Alzadick. It was programmed by Shinobu Yagawa, whose later works includes Battle Garegga, Ibara, Pink Sweets: Ibara Sorekara and Muchi Muchi Pork!. The game was released in Japan amid focus shifting to the Super Famicom, resulting in few copies sold when released to the market and is considered by gaming journalists as one of the rarest, most valuable and sought-after Famicom titles.
Recca received mostly positive reception from critics for pushing the Famicom to its limits; praise was given to the fun factor, action, game modes and music but criticism was geared towards the unsuitable difficulty for beginners and graphics. It was re-released worldwide on the 3DS Virtual Console via Nintendo eShop in 2012 and 2013, marking the game's first international appearance. Retrospective commentary has been positive and is regarded as a precursor to modern bullet hell games.
