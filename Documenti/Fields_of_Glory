Titolo: Fields of Glory

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Fields of Glory is a  real-time strategy video game published by MicroProse in 1993.  In the game players can re-enact the four major historical battles in Napoleon's Waterloo campaign (The Battle of Ligny, Battle of Quatre-Bras, Battle of Waterloo and the Battle of Wavre), as well play two hypothetical battles (at Nivelles and Wagnee) which would have possibly taken place had some of the pre-campaign maneuvering been done differently. The battles in the game are fought in real-time, and strive to create a sense of realism. It is based on a series of tabletop games of the same name.
