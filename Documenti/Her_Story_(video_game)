Titolo: Her Story (video game)

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Her Story is an interactive film video game written and directed by Sam Barlow. It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS, and the following year for Android. In the game, the player searches and sorts through a database of video clips from fictional police interviews, and uses the clips to solve the case of a missing man. The police interviews focus on the man's wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert.
The game is Barlow's first project since his departure from Climax Studios, after which he became independent. He wanted to develop a game that was dependent on the narrative, and avoided working on the game until he was settled on an idea that was possible to execute. Barlow eventually decided to create a police procedural game, and incorporate live action footage. He conducted research for the game by watching existing police interviews. Upon doing so, he discovered recurring themes in the suspects' answers, and decided to incorporate ambiguity to the investigation in the game.
At release, Her Story was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at the narrative, character performance, and unconventional gameplay mechanics. The game has sold over 100,000 copies, and was nominated for multiple year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. In August 2019, a spiritual sequel titled Telling Lies was released.
