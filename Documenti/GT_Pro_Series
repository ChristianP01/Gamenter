Titolo: GT Pro Series

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: GT Pro Series is a racing video game developed by MTO and published by Ubisoft as a launch title for Wii. It includes over 80 licensed Japanese cars, next-gen physics and many gameplay modes, including Championship, Quick Race, Time Attack, Versus (4 players), Drift, and Replay.
Graphically, the game uses a cel-shaded style.
Critics have noted that the graphics are generally underwhelming, according to IGN. This is because the visuals are largely ported from the older GameCube game GT Cube with minor updates. GT Cube was released in Japan in 2003 for the Nintendo GameCube.
