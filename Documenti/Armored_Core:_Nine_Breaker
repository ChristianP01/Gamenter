Descrizione: Armored Core: Nine Breaker is a 2004 third-person shooter mecha video game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 2. It is the ninth entry in the Armored Core series and a spin-off to Armored Core: Nexus.
Nine Breaker removed story missions and placed much more focus on the Arena mode found in previous games. Training missions reveal that an organization has put the Arena mode together in order to train pilots for a potential future war as currently all corporations are at peace.
Players pilot mech robots called Armored Cores in a competitive Arena ladder. Armored Cores can be customized with hundreds of parts, with some parts only available after completing certain achievements. A training mode allows for players to practice certain skills that can help them within the Arena and allow them to unlock additional parts for their mech.
