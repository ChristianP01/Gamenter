Titolo: Emily is Away Too

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Emily is Away Too is a 2017 indie visual novel by Kyle Seeley. It is the spiritual successor to the 2015 video game Emily is Away. The game is primarily set in an instant messaging chat client, taking place during the protagonistâ€™s last year of high school during the 2006-07 school year. The player talks to other characters by selecting different responses, and specific choices change the course of the plot throughout the game. In addition to using the chat log, the player also visits parody websites such as YouToob and Facenook, all of which display their 2006/2007 layouts.
