Descrizione: Cosmic Break (Japanese: コズミックブレイク, Hepburn: Kozumikku Bureiku, also stylized as CosmicBreak) is a free to play 3D MMO third-person shooter with big robots and colorful, explosive battles in an anime style. The game was developed and published by the Japanese company CyberStep, Inc. and has been officially released in several countries, including Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and North America, with other areas like the EU, Germany and France preparing for official release. CosmicBreak is the sequel to another game by CyberStep, called C21 Steel Battle Chronicles, but contains more anime-styled characters, deeper developed story lines and offers thus more immersion.  Several story lines have also been made into manga and short movies, which are connected to some of the quests in the game. As is the case with GetAmped2, Cosmic Break also has various NPCs and playable characters voiced by famous Japanese voice-over artists. Among these are Rie Tanaka (Icy, Ivis), Akio Ōtsuka (Draken), Takeshi Kusao (Lios), Asami Shimoda (Crimrose, Lily Rain), Atsuko Tanaka (Koko Gaap, Winberrl) and Daisuke Sakaguchi (Jikun Hu).In 2015, a sequel game, with different mechanics and cast, Cosmic League (Cosmic Break 2) was announced for development and had a failed Kickstarter campaign was launched that raised less than half of its target. Regardless, CosmicBreak 2 was released in the Summer of 2015 with a new cast of humanoid robots and an original story and was planned to continue service alongside its initial counterpart. Both games have shut down service in the U.S.
In 2021, after a hiatus, an improved version of the game, CosmicBreak Universal, was made live on Steam.
