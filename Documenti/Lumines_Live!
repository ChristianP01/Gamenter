Titolo: Lumines Live!

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Lumines Live! is a 2006 puzzle video game developed by Q Entertainment for the Xbox 360. It was released in Europe in October 2006, in North America in January 2007, and in Japan in March 2007. The objective of the game is to move and rotate 2Ã—2 blocks to form colored squares of the same color. Points are awarded to the player when the Time Line erases the colored squares. Lumines Live! introduces online multiplayer, Xbox Live achievements, and leaderboard.
During development, game producer Tetsuya Mizuguchi intended Lumines Live! to be customizable for players via downloadable content (DLC). One of the challenges during development was to have the game size be fifty megabytes due to Xbox Live's file size restrictions. It received several DLC packages between January 2007 to October 2007, a mobile phone port, and a physical edition compiled with Every Extend Extra Extreme and Rez HD in September 2009. The game was received mixed reviews from critics with some critics praising the new features, enhancements in performance, and visuals from its predecessor but also had received complaints about the amount of content the base game had and pricing.
