Titolo: Microsoft Solitaire Collection

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Microsoft Solitaire Collection is a video game for Microsoft Windows and included with Windows 10 and Windows 11. It is developed by Next Level Games under the Microsoft Casual Games brand. It combines the Solitaire, FreeCell and Spider Solitaire titles that were included with previous versions of Windows. It also introduces Pyramid and TriPeaks to Windows for the first time, as well as new daily challenges and themes. (An older version of Pyramid was previously bundled in Microsoft Entertainment Pack 2 under the name "Tut's Tomb", and an older version of TriPeaks was previously bundled in Microsoft Entertainment Pack 3; both made the cut for Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack.) Unlike the games included in Windows 7 and earlier versions, Microsoft Solitaire Collection is freemium adware with Xbox Live integration.
The app's hub-based design was originally inspired by the design for Windows 8's Start screen in 2012. At the time, the developers considered the game a tool for helping users become more familiar with Windows 8. Unlike its predecessors, Microsoft Solitaire Collection is updated via the Microsoft Store and communicates with a Microsoft server in order to track achievements and offer daily challenges.
