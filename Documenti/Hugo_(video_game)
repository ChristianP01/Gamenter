Titolo: Hugo (video game)

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: There are several Hugo video games based on early episodes of ITE's television show Hugo and are a part of the international Hugo franchise. From 1992 to 2000, ITE developed and released versions for Amiga, Commodore 64 and PC, as well as for PlayStation consoles, exclusively for European markets. Since 2011, Krea Media / Hugo Games has published a series of mobile game remakes for Android. Online slot machine adaptations were also released in 2016 and 2018.
The games closely resemble the early editions of the TV show they have been adapted from; in almost all of them, the player guides the titular protagonist (a small, friendly troll named Hugo) to save his wife and children from the evil witch Scylla. To rescue his family, Hugo must navigate safely through dangerous environments in various minigame scenarios.
