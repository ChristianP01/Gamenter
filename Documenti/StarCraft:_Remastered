Titolo: StarCraft: Remastered

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: StarCraft: Remastered is a remastered edition of the 1998 real-time strategy video game StarCraft and its expansion Brood War, which was released on August 14, 2017. It retains the gameplay of the original StarCraft, but features ultra-high-definition graphics (ultra HD), re-recorded audio, and Blizzard's modern online feature suite. The remaster was developed over the period of a year and included playtesting from professional StarCraft players.
StarCraft: Remastered was the first project released by the "Classic Games division", a team at Blizzard focused on updating and remastering some of their older titles, with an initially announced focus on StarCraft, Diablo II, and Warcraft III. Prior to release, the original StarCraft and its expansion were both made free to download and play. The remaster features redone visuals and sound assets while still using the same engine as the original, which allows for cross-play compatibility across both versions.
It received favorable reviews upon release, with many critics praising its success in updating the visuals while leaving the gameplay unchanged.
