Descrizione: Asphalt 3: Street Rules is a racing video game by Gameloft Shanghai that was released in 2006 on Java-based mobile phones, in 2007 on non-Java based mobile phones and was also released in 2008 for Nokia's N-Gage 2.0 gaming platform. It is the first mobile game to be played at the World Cyber Games competition. It was the first in the series not to be released for the Nintendo DS.
The gameplay includes an "Instant Race" mode, where the player is placed in a random city's race with any one of the player's owned cars, and a "Career" mode, which is the heart of the game. The player starts with a Mini Cooper S and has the option of unlocking 11 other sports cars and bikes, each with their own tuning. The initial game ends when the player has finished all of the races with a podium finish. The final end comes when the player has achieved a 'Gold' in all of the events, and is thus declared the best in the 'underground racing league'. Even after completing the career mode, the player can still take part in any of the events to earn more money.
