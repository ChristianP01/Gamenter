Titolo: Alex Kidd: High-Tech World

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Alex Kidd: High Tech World is a side-scrolling action-adventure video game combining adventure, platforming and puzzle-solving elements, released by Sega in 1989 for the Master System, as part of the Alex Kidd series. It is a modified version of the 1987 Japanese Master System game Anmitsu Hime (あんみつ姫, "Princess Anmitsu"), which was based on a manga series of the same name.Alterations made to the English version included altered sprites, English text and a different storyline. Because the game was not conceived as an Alex Kidd game in Japan, these alterations caused inconsistencies for the Alex Kidd storyline in the West, such as an appearance of Alex's father in the very beginning of the game, even though his father was missing in Alex Kidd in Miracle World, until being found at the end of Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle. Furthermore, while a large variety of characters exist in the game, none of the previously-established characters in the Alex Kidd-universe are anywhere to be found, nor do any of the characters in this game appear in any of the others in the series.
Alex also has a brother by the name of James in High-Tech World who is never mentioned in any other games in the series.
