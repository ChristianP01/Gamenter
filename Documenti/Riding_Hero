Descrizione: Riding Hero is a hybrid racing/role-playing arcade video game developed and originally published by SNK on July 24, 1990. It was the first title for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms that featured "Multi Play" (Multi-Link) support, which allowed two systems to be connected via a phone jack port integrated into each cartridge for versus LAN play.In the game, players have the choice to participate on a worldwide grand prix tour against AI-controlled opponents, assume the role of a protagonist who embark on a quest to enter the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race or compete in matches against other human players. Riding Hero was first launched for the Neo Geo MVS before being later released for both Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD in 1991 and 1995 respectively, in addition to being re-released through download services for various consoles, among other ways to play it as of date.Since its initial launch, Riding Hero has been met with a mixed reception from both critics and reviewers alike who felt divided in regards to various aspects such as the visuals, sound design, controls and gameplay, though some regarded the single-player role-playing game mode as a novel concept and the multiplayer offering was noted to be one of the game's positive points. Its multiplayer LAN support would later be re-used in other titles for Neo Geo.
