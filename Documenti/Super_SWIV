Descrizione: Super SWIV (Firepower 2000 in the US) is a top-down shoot 'em up released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. It was released as Mega SWIV on the Mega Drive in 1994. It was followed by SWIV 3D in 1996.
The game's story involves a secret underground race on an island in the Atlantic Ocean which has stolen top military vehicles and equipment from around the world and built powerful war machines from them. Military and intelligence officials of major countries detect them, but are afraid that they will be unable to prepare against an assault by this underground race. They send the player character in to infiltrate their base and destroy them.
Players can control either a helicopter or a jeep. The helicopter is not stopped by obstacles but the jeep can fire in any direction. There are nine weapons (five permanent, four short-lasting specials) the player can pick up along the way.
