Descrizione: Muppet Adventure: Chaos at the Carnival is a video game released for the Apple II, Commodore 64 and MS-DOS in 1989 by Hi Tech Expressions.  It was ported to Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990.  The game features Muppets created by Jim Henson in a series of carnival-inspired mini games searching for enough keys to rescue Miss Piggy from Dr. Grump. These mini games include Bumper Cars, Funhouse, Tunnel of Love, Duck Hunt and Space Ride. The game was initially released for the Apple IIc with a bug which caused it to be unwinnable. Upon achieving the win condition versus Dr. Grump, the game would enter an endless cycle of taking the player back to a previous level, instead of having Dr. Grump be defeated.
