Titolo: Fin Fin on Teo the Magic Planet

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Fin Fin on Teo the Magic Planet (stylized as fin fin: On TEO, the Magic Planet) is a 1996 computer game for Windows-based computers made by Fujitsu about a creature that is a hybrid of a bird and a dolphin which the user could communicate with via a microphone which came with the game, with a webcam add-on called the SmartSensor. Fin Fin was produced by Makoto Tezuka.
Fin Fin responds to the player's tone of voice and volume of the voice - one reviewer describing Fin Fin as a 'virtual mood ring'.  30,000 copies were sold in the first year in Japan.Fin Fin is much like the popular Tamagotchi, but for a PC. If he is not fed or paid enough attention, he would sing a sad whistling song or sometimes fly away.
There are different versions of Fin Fin and each version has a limited number of worlds available. There was a 3-world version, a 4-world version, a 5-world version, and a 6-world version (which has all the worlds).
Described as "experiential multimedia", it was reported that Fujitsu had invested "seven years of hardware and software research" in the general techniques of artificial life and "new graphics technology", the latter manifesting itself in this specific title through a claimed 40,000 polygons being used to animate Fin Fin at ten frames per second, with most screens in the game supposedly requiring one million polygons in their presentation. At the time, Fujitsu sought to broaden its business beyond hardware into multimedia software, reportedly making half of its $3.6 million research and development budget available to multimedia applications.
