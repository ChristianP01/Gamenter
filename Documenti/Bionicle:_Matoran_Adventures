Titolo: Bionicle: Matoran Adventures

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Bionicle: Matoran Adventures is a 2002 platform game based on Lego's Bionicle line of constructible action figures. It was developed by Argonaut Games and co-published by Electronic Arts and Lego Interactive for the Game Boy Advance. The player controls Matoran and Turaga characters, who must work together to repel the invasion of Bohrok, insect-like robots that threaten the island of Mata Nui. 
The game features six levels and three boss battles. Matoran can jump higher and throw discs, while Turaga can activate switches and destroy obstacles; players can switch between the two during gameplay depending on need, similar to the 1993 video game The Lost Vikings. Additional characters can be unlocked by collecting mask pieces scattered throughout levels. Matoran Adventures received mixed reviews from critics. The gameplay and charm were praised by some, with some comparing it favorably to The Lost Vikings, while its short length and lack of creativity were more poorly received.
