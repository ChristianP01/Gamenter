Titolo: Dragon Ball Z: Buyū Retsuden

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Dragon Ball Z: Buyū Retsuden is a 1994 fighting video game developed and published by Bandai and Ecofilmes for the Sega Mega Drive. Based upon Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball franchise, it is the only game in the series released for the Mega Drive, following the Frieza and Cell sagas. Its gameplay has been described as a combination of the original Super Butōden and Super Butōden 2, consisting of one-on-one fights using a three-button configuration, featuring special moves and two playable modes.
With the popularity of the Dragon Ball franchise in European regions and the positive reception of the first Super Butōden entry on Super Famicom, Bandai decided developing Dragon Ball Z: Buyū Retsuden for the Mega Drive but its creation process lasted longer than the Super Butōden sub-series. Buyū Retsuden proved popular among players and garnered generally positive reception from critics; Some reviewers praised the addition of characters not featured in the previous Super NES games, split-screen mechanic, audiovisual presentation and gameplay, but other stated it was not on par with both Street Fighter II: The World Warrior and Mortal Kombat, criticizing certain design choices and slow pacing.
