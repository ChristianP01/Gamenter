Descrizione: RealFlight RC Simulator is a radio-controlled airplane and helicopter simulation software series developed by Knife Edge Software and now published by Horizon Hobby. The software allows for the flying of numerous RC aircraft, helicopters and drones so that the user can learn to fly RC, practice their skills or fly with others in multiplayer mode.
Note: Although RealFlight RC Simulator has a similar name to Real Flight Simulator it has nothing to do with it. Real Flight Simulator (goes around with a few different names) is a commercial rebranding of an old version of the free and opensource flight simulator Flightgear.Included with RealFlight RC Simulator are various flying sites (or airports) and aircraft models, almost all of which represent real-life models. The software also includes an airport editor and an aircraft editor to allow for the creation of new flying sites and aircraft. Within RealFlight, editing aircraft is limited to changing the physical and aerodynamic properties. In order to create new visual models, the use of a 3D modeling application such as Autodesk 3ds Max or Blender is required.
The software is released in "generations," with each new generation including major updates and new features. The most recent is RealFlight 9, which included additions such as water and water physics, an improved user interface, more aircraft, more flying sites, and an improved "InterLink Elite" controller. RealFlight requires the connection of an InterLink controller, which is included with the software, in order to operate.
