Titolo: Mass Effect 3: Omega

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Mass Effect 3: Omega is a major downloadable content (DLC) pack developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for the 2012 action role-playing video game Mass Effect 3. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 27, 2012, with a delayed release in Europe on the PlayStation 3 platform set for November 28, 2012. The pack follows Commander Shepard and the asari pirate queen Aria T'Loak as they attempt to liberate the space station Omega from the anthropocentric terrorist group Cerberus. Omega expanded beyond the developers' original plan during its development cycle, both in response to a mandate of freedom by BioWare management and as a result of the development team's desire to develop the experience they wanted, and incorporates cut content from the main game.
Omega received mixed reviews from critics; the temporary squadmates who join Shepard for the duration of the DLC pack and the new enemy types they face are generally well received, while its strong emphasis on linear combat sequences, lack of compelling storytelling, and price point of the pack has been criticized.
