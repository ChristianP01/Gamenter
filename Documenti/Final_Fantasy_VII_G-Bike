Titolo: Final Fantasy VII G-Bike

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Final Fantasy VII G-Bike was a free-to-play video game for Android and iOS platforms. Available between October 2014 and December 2015, the title was a racing game with role-playing elements. Based on Square Enix's role-playing game Final Fantasy VII, the player controlled the protagonist of that game, Cloud Strife. While riding on a motorcycle, Cloud battled enemies with melee weapons and magic with help from other Final Fantasy VII characters. Players could modify Cloud's weapons, clothing and motorcycle, and perform powerful attacks known as limit breaks.
Square Enix and developer CyberConnect2 conceived of the game as a series of titles for mobile devices that would see the Final Fantasy VII mini-games remade. In the development process, they settled on only the most popular title, G-Bike. Developers expanded on the original idea for the mini-game in areas such as customization and gameplay but did not add an overarching story.
Critics had mixed reactions due to it not being the remake of the original Final Fantasy VII for which fans had been hoping. However, they still found the game visually appealing and faithful to the original mini-games aesthetic. Square Enix shut down the game in 2015.
