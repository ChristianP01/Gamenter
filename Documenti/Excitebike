Titolo: Excitebike

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Excitebike is a motocross racing video game developed and published by Nintendo. In Japan, it was released for the Famicom in 1984 and then ported to arcades as Vs. Excitebike for the Nintendo Vs. System later the same year. In North America, it was initially released for arcades in 1985 and then as a launch title for the Nintendo Entertainment System later the same year. It is the first game in the Excite series.
The game was a critical and commercial success. Designed and directed by Shigeru Miyamoto, the smooth side-scrolling game engine his team developed for Excitebike was later used to develop Super Mario Bros. (1985), which had the effect of Mario smoothly accelerating from a walk to a run, rather than move at a constant speed.
Excitebike spawned a number of sequels and has been re-released multiple times onto other Nintendo platforms, such the Wii and Wii U via the Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch via its online service.
