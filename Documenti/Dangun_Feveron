Titolo: Dangun Feveron

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Dangun Feveron is a 1998 vertical-scrolling shooter arcade game developed by Cave and published by Nihon System in Japan. Players control a fighter craft and must destroy waves of enemies throughout a series of scrolling stages that increase in difficulty. The game's scoring system is designed to encourage players to destroy as many enemies possible, as points are subtracted based on how many enemies leave the screen. It is known for its elaborate disco-inspired presentation, soundtrack, and sassy voiceovers.
Developed in conjunction with ESP Ra.De. (1998), Dangun Feveron began production as a more generic take on the scrolling shooter genre. The disco theme was chosen after Cave received negative feedback from location testing, and wanting the game to have its own unique ideas and mechanics. Critics praised the game's unique scoring system and absurdity, though some questioned the quality of the gameplay itself. Feveron did not see any contemporary home ports until it was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2016 by M2.
