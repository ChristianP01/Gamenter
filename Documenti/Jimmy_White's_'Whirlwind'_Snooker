Titolo: Jimmy White's 'Whirlwind' Snooker

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Jimmy White's 'Whirlwind' Snooker is a video game by Archer MacLean, released by Virgin Games in 1991 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and IBM PC compatibles (later for the Mega Drive). A port for the Atari Lynx was planned but never released. 'Whirlwind' Snooker is a realistic snooker simulator.
Although the game was not the first to simulate snooker (or pool) in 3D, it used the processing power and graphics capabilities of 16-bit home computers and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use interface. ACE said that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table which existed at the time, and it could be used by a player to refine real-life snooker skills.
