Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Garfield: Caught in the Act is a 1995 side-scrolling platform video game originally developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. Versions for the Sega Game Gear and Microsoft Windows were also released. It is based upon Jim Davis' comic strip cat, Garfield, and draws inspiration from Davis' 1984 book Garfield: His 9 Lives. Odie scares Garfield while they are watching television and they fall on the TV, breaking it. Both characters attempt to repair it before Jon Arbuckle catches them; however, the thrown spare parts become an electronic monster known as the Glitch, transporting Garfield into the TV, where he must defeat him in order to get out.
Garfield: Caught in the Act was met with mixed reception from critics.
