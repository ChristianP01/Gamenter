Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Iron Soldier 3 is an open world first-person mecha simulation video game developed by Eclipse Software Design and originally published by Vatical Entertainment for the PlayStation on 20 June 2000 and was ported to the Nuon in 2001. A sequel to Iron Soldier 2, it is the third and last installment of the Iron Soldier series.
Set after the events of the second game, players assume the role of an elite defense pilot taking control of the titular mech in order to complete tasks and protect areas that conforms the United Republic from attacks of the returning PENTA corporation. Iron Soldier 3 was conceived after release of the second entry and originally intended to be an exclusive first-party title by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation before the deal was cancelled, leading to both Vatical Entertainment and Telegames handling publishing duties instead while VM Labs published the Nuon port, with the two versions featuring various differences. Versions for PlayStation 2 and Xbox were in development but not released.
Iron Soldier 3 garnered mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release on the PlayStation and later on Nuon, with many feeling divided in regards to several aspects such as the visuals, audio, presentation and gameplay, which was deemed by some as sluggish and comparing with other titles in the same genre such as Armored Core and Gungriffon.
