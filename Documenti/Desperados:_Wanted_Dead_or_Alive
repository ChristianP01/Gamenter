Descrizione: Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive is a real-time tactics video game developed by Spellbound Entertainment and published by Infogrames for Microsoft Windows.
In the game, the player controls up to six characters in a wild west setting. The protagonist is a worldly knife-fighter and gunslinger, John Cooper. He takes on a bounty to capture a notorious train-robber named "El Diablo". As Cooper sets off on his quest, he is aided by five other friends and they work together in a real-time, stealth-based structure very similar to that introduced in Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, although all-out gunfights are still highly possible in the game.
A sequel called Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge was released in late March 2006. A second sequel, Helldorado (announced as expansion pack Desperados 2: Conspiracy but made into a full game) was released in mid-2007 in Germany. The English version was released in some regions in November 2007. 
Spellbound was developing a follow-up with more multiplayer and steampunk-oriented elements, Desperados Gangs,  but they shut down before they could find a publisher.A fourth entry, Desperados III, was developed by Mimimi Productions and published by THQ Nordic. The game was released for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2020.
