Titolo: Dragon Ball Z: Super Butōden 3

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Dragon Ball Z: Super Butōden 3 is a 1994 fighting video game developed by Tose and published by Bandai for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Based upon Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball franchise, it is the sequel to Dragon Ball Z: Super Butōden 2, which was released earlier in 1993 for SNES. Following the Majin Buu arc, its gameplay remains relatively the same as the previous two Super Butōden entries, consisting of one-on-one fights using a main six-button configuration, featuring special moves as well as two playable modes.
Dragon Ball Z: Super Butōden 3 was created by most of the same team who previously worked on the first two Super Butōden entries on Super Nintendo, with producer Toshihiro Suzuki returning to lead its production, with additional support from staff of both Toei Animation and V Jump magazine. Like its predecessors, Super Butōden 3 garnered positive reception from critics, however the lack of a story mode was heavily criticized by reviewers.
