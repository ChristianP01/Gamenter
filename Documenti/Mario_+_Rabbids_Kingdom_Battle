Titolo: Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is a turn-based strategy and adventure game, featuring one or multiple player gameplay. The game was developed by Ubisoft's Milan division for the Nintendo Switch and published by the parent company Ubisoft. Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is a crossover between Nintendo's Mario and Ubisoft's Rabbids franchise. In the game, the player control a group of characters, containing Mario, his friends, and a group of "Rabbids". The story line starts with another group of invading Rabbids which accidentally misused a powerful invention, bringing chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom of the Mario franchise.
Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle was conceived in 2014 by the Ubisoft Milan's creative director Davide Soliani and Ubisoft brand producer Xavier Manzanares. The design objectives were emphasizing the dissonance of both franchises and creating a strategy game that stood out with unique elements. Therefore, its visual elements and animation were made casual and vibrant, and its music were made by a well known video game composer Grant Kirkhope. Although the game was met with poor reception when it was leaked, it was revered at the official revealing at E3 2017 trade event.
The game's critical reception was overall positive, with an almost universal acclaim towards its unique simplistic strategy. However, it received mixed reviews of the puzzles and the franchise blend. In 2018, an expansion pack of the game titled Donkey Kong Adventure was released as downloadable content. A sequel, titled Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, is planned for a 2022 release.
