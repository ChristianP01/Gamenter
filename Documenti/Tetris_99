Anno: 2019

Descrizione: Tetris 99 is an online version of the tile-matching video game Tetris, developed by Arika, and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch in February 2019. The software is free, but only to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. Incorporating elements of the battle royale genre, Tetris 99 has up to 99 players competing simultaneously to complete rows with falling tetrominoes, which in turn send attacks in the form of "garbage rows" to other players with the goal of knocking them out of the game.
Arika would later develop similar games called Super Mario Bros. 35 and Pac-Man 99, which instead involve the games Super Mario Bros. and Pac-Man, respectively. The former also allowed up to a maximum of 35 players.
