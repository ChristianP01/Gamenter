Titolo: Bokuhime Project

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Bokuhime Project is a mystery adventure video game developed by Wizard Soft. It was published by Nippon Ichi Software in Japan for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in 2020, and for Microsoft Windows in 2021. The player takes the role of a young man who infiltrates a school for refined young ladies by enrolling as a female student to investigate an incident involving his sister. As part of their investigation, the player aims to get a seat in an influential organization at the school, and thereby needs to improve their character statistics to raise their character's cuteness, overcoming the other candidates.
The game was directed by Tatsuya Shiina and written by Kento Jobana, with art by Fumika Matsushima, and was originally conceived as an action game, but replanned as an adventure game due to budget concerns. Initially teased in 2017, the project was halted as the publisher was uncertain about the size of the market for a game about cross-dressing; development was eventually greenlit after they had gauged interest through Twitter and built a following by serializing Daukokudo Ikuya's manga Bokuhime-sama to Otome Shugi. Other related media include three short audio dramas and an upcoming short story; Jobana has also mentioned that he wants to develop a sequel to the game set in the Meiji era (1868â€“1912).
Critics liked the game, calling its themes unique, and praising its story, characters and visuals, but were divided in their opinion on the gameplay. It was ranked as a highly anticipated game among Japanese players in a survey conducted by Famitsu, and almost sold out at online retailers during its first weeks on sale; the developers later described the game as a moderate success. By November 2020, it was noted to have been a contributing factor to the publisher making a profit in the six-month period following its release.
