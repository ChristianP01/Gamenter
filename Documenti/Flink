Titolo: Flink

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Flink (full name: The Misadventures of Flink according to the title screen) is a 2D scrolling platform video game developed by former members of Thalion and published by Psygnosis.
The Amiga CD32 and Sega CD versions are reliant on CD-ROM media to store large levels, highly detailed graphics, and high-quality music. Except for the CD soundtrack, the Mega Drive and Sega CD versions are identical. All versions were published in Europe by Psygnosis, but only the Sega CD version was released in the United States, published by Vic Tokai.
Flink is one of the few Amiga CD32 titles not to see a release for the Amiga home computer on which the CD32's hardware is based.
The creators, Erwin Kloibhofer, Henk Nieborg, and Matthias Steinwachs, had previously worked on the Thalion game Lionheart for the Amiga 500. In 1996, Kloibhofer and Nieborg collaborated one last time on The Adventures of Lomax for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows.
