Titolo: Baldies

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Baldies is a real-time strategy video game developed by Creative Edge Software and originally published by Atari Corporation for the Atari Jaguar CD in North America and Europe on December 1995. In the game, players build and manage a community of the titular short and plump bald characters with the ultimate goal of conquering the world by defeating similarly-looking short little hairy people known as the "Hairies". Its gameplay mainly consists of strategy taking place during real-time, combining both simulation and god game elements as well, while online multiplayer with up to four players using a modem or over a local area network is only supported on PC.
Conceived and written by Creative Edge Software founder David Wightman, Baldies originally started as a project intended for the Amiga platforms in early 1993 and was set to be released by Mindscape before publishing duties were transferred to GameTek instead, however this early version of the game was never officially released for unknown reasons until it was converted and completed on the Jaguar CD. Initially an exclusive for the add-on, it was later ported by Creative Edge to MS-DOS, Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Sega Saturn between 1996 and 1998, all of which were released by several publishers across multiple regions and each one features various changes and additions compared with the original version respectively.
Baldies garnered mixed reception after its initial launch on Jaguar CD; praise was lent to the level of freedom given to players in doing anything but the simplistic graphics, sound design, gameplay and learning curve were a point of contention for critics and reviewers alike, while the other ports released afterwards received more mixed reception. Critics also compared it with titles such as Lemmings due to its premise and quirkiness. Ports for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and Amiga CD32 were also in development but never published. A sequel named Skull Caps, also developed by the same development team and published by Ubi Soft exclusively for Windows, was released in 1999 but had little success when compared to its predecessor.
