Titolo: Shining Force II

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Shining Force II (シャイニング・フォースII 古えの封印, Shainingu Fōsu Tsū: Inishie no Fūin, lit. "Shining Force II: The Ancient Seal") is a tactical role-playing game for the Mega Drive/Genesis console developed by Sonic! Software Planning in 1993. Its storyline is not directly connected to the original Shining Force, although a Game Gear title Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict links the two games' plots.
The game is much longer than the first and more free-roaming. There is no chapter system, so the player can return to previously visited parts of the world.  There are also two different ways of promoting many characters.
This game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe on October 3, 2008, and in North America on October 6, 2008. It  also appears in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and as a standalone game on Steam.
