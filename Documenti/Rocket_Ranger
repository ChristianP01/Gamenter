Titolo: Rocket Ranger

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Rocket Ranger is a 1988 action-adventure game computer game developed and published by Cinemaware. The game's setting is based in the World War II era, allowing the player to control a US Army scientist and setting out to stop Nazi Germany from winning the war. The Rocket Ranger moniker stems from the Rocket Pack the player uses over the course of the game.
Like many Cinemaware games, Rocket Ranger draws its inspiration from Hollywood, and likely The Rocketeer comics. This title pays homage to the many 1950s sci-fi serials, using the look and feel of the serials, including action-packed cut-scenes and an art treatment loyal to the futuristic visions of that era. It also features the clich√© elements of that era, including a dashing, courageous hero and a beautiful, voluptuous damsel in distress in need of rescue.
