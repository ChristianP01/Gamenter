Descrizione: Dead Space: Extraction is a 2009 rail shooter co-developed by EA Redwood Shores and Eurocom and published by Electronic Arts for the Wii. A port for PlayStation 3 was released in 2011 alongside Dead Space 2. A spin-off within the Dead Space series and a prequel to the original game, the story follows survivors from the Aegis VII mining colony as the planet and newly-arrived ship USG Ishimura is overrun by deadly monsters called Necromorphs. Gameplay involves going through scripted sequences with different characters, using assigned weapons to kill Necromorphs by severing their limbs. Each version respectively supported the Wii Zapper and PlayStation Move peripherals.
Conceived during the development of the original game, production began in 2008 using Eurocom's EngineX game engine. The aim was to create an experience similar to the original game within the genre and hardware limitations. The script was written by Antony Johnston, who worked on the original game and its expanded media, while Jason Graves returned as the game's composer. Announced in 2009, it was used by Electronic Arts as a test for mature games in the Wii gaming market. During its original release, sales of the game were poor. All versions of the game have seen positive reviews, with praise going to its gameplay and use of the Dead Space setting and mechanics.
