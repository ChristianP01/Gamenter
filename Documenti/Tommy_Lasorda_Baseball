Titolo: Tommy Lasorda Baseball

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Tommy Lasorda Baseball is a 1989 baseball video game developed and published by Sega as one of the six launch titles for the Sega Genesis in the North America and for the Sega Mega-Tech arcade system. It is a follow-up to the arcade game Super League (1987). It prominently features former MLB player Tommy Lasorda, who was manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers at the time. In the game, players compete with either AI-controlled opponents or against other players across single exhibitions, open matches or a 30-game season.
Tommy Lasorda Baseball formed part of a marketing campaign to build a library of titles using recognizable names and likenesses of celebrities and athletes to emphasize the more arcade-like experience available on Sega Genesis. The game garnered mixed to positive reception from critics since its release on the Genesis; praise was given to the addition of season play, use of multiple perspectives, sound, two-player component and gameplay but criticism was geared towards this aspect being luck-based and difficult AI, while others felt mixed in regards to the graphical quality and recommended similar titles instead.
