Titolo: Bound High!

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Bound High! is an unreleased action-puzzle video game that was in development by Japan System Supply and planned to be published by Nintendo on a scheduled 1996 release date exclusively for the Virtual Boy. In the game, players take control of a transforming robot named Chalvo through a series of levels riddled with hazardous obstacles to avoid across multiple worlds, while destroying or knocking out alien invaders off the area. The project was first conceptualized by designer and programmer Hideyuki Nakanishi, who wrote the idea on paper and placed it within a wall inside the offices of Japan System Supply, with his manager eventually greenlighting its development after seeing it.
Although showcased at various trading shows and completed for release, Bound High! was ultimately shelved due to the failure of the Virtual Boy itself. After its cancellation, a follow-up on the Game Boy titled Chalvo 55 was released in 1997. Despite its cancellation, a ROM image of the complete game was leaked online in 2010 by the hobbyist community at Planet Virtual Boy, allowing for it to be played.
