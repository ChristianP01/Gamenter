Descrizione: The Getaway is an action-adventure open world video game developed by Team Soho and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. The Getaway is inspired by British gangster films, most notably Get Carter and Snatch. Initially, the release of the game was to coincide with the launch of the PlayStation 2 in 2000, but was delayed by 27 months due to the difficulty of re-creating large areas of London in high resolution. Parts of The Getaway feature in various episodes of Graham Duff's Ideal.The game focuses on two characters each with their own plot settings, Mark Hammond, an ex-bank robber, and Detective Constable Frank Carter, a police officer in service with the Flying Squad, with both plots running parallel and intersecting before concluding in the finale of the game. A sequel, entitled The Getaway: Black Monday, was released in 2004.
