Titolo: Megamania

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Megamania is an Atari 2600 game by Steve Cartwright and published by Activision in 1982. Versions were released for the Atari 5200 and Atari 8-bit family in 1983. Megamania is similar to Sega's 1981 arcade title Astro Blaster.  Both games have nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an "energy" meter.  The player's ships are remarkably similar in both games.
The game took Cartwright six months to initially develop and another three months to fine-tune.
The band The Tubes performed a Megamania theme song in a 1982 television commercial advertising the Atari 2600 version of the game.
