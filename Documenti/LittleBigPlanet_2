Descrizione: LittleBigPlanet 2 is a puzzle-platform game that features user-generated content. The game is developed by Media Molecule, published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3. It was released in January 2011. The game was released in North America on 18 January 2011, in mainland Europe on 19 January 2011, in Australia and New Zealand on 20 January 2011 and the UK and Ireland on 21 January 2011.
It is a direct sequel to LittleBigPlanet (2008) and the third game in the series following a PSP version (2009). Most of the more than 3 million levels created by users in the first game carry over and are playable and editable in LittleBigPlanet 2. Unlike its predecessor, which was marketed as a platform game, LittleBigPlanet 2 was marketed as a "platform for games". Support for PlayStation Move was added to the game through a software update in September 2011, allowing users to play the game using the PlayStation Move motion controller in conjunction with a Navigation Controller or gamepad. The game's online functionality was officially discontinued after a lengthy period of outage on 13 September 2021, alongside services for LittleBigPlanet (2008), LittleBigPlanet PS Vita, and the PlayStation 3 version of LittleBigPlanet 3.
