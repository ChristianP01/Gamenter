Titolo: The Hobbit (2003 video game)

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: The Hobbit is a 2003 action-adventure game developed by Inevitable Entertainment for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, by The Fizz Factor for Microsoft Windows, and by Saffire for the Game Boy Advance. It was published by Sierra Entertainment. 
The game is a licensed adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's 1937 novel The Hobbit, and has no relationship with the Peter Jackson-directed The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. At the time, Vivendi, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to the video game adaptations of Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to the video game adaptations of the New Line Cinema films. The game sticks very closely to the plot of the novel, although it does feature some minor characters not found in Tolkien's original.
The Hobbit received mixed reviews, with critics praising its fidelity to the source material, but finding the gameplay unoriginal and too easy.
