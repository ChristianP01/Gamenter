Titolo: Oids

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Oids is a multidirectional shooter developed and self-published by FTL Games in 1987. The game was originally released on the Atari ST, followed by a conversion for the Macintosh in 1990. The game follows in the footsteps of shoot 'em ups such as Asteroids (1979), Gravitar (1982) and Thrust (1986), with its "thrust-and-rotate" controls, inertia and gravity-based movement, 360 degree shooting and manually-operated shield. The main activity in the game is rescuing abused android slaves (the "Oids" of the title), and there is rather more emphasis on arcade action than the slower paced gameplay of Gravitar and Thrust. The Atari ST version, created entirely by Dan Hewitt, was a cult favorite in the UK, where it received rave reviews.
A version for the Amiga was eventually released in 2014, based on reverse engineering the Atari ST game.
