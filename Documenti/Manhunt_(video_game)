Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Manhunt is a 2003 stealth based survival horror video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, originally released for the PlayStation 2 in November 2003, and for Microsoft Windows and Xbox in April 2004. Manhunt was re-released through the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 in 2013 and PlayStation 4 in 2016. Set within the fictional Carcer City, the story follows James Earl Cash, a death row prisoner who is forced to participate in a series of snuff films, earning his freedom by murdering criminal gang members sent to hunt him on camera.
The game received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise directed at its dark, gritty tone and violent gameplay, winning several accolades and gaining a substantial cult following. Manhunt was subject to a significant video game controversy due to the level of graphic violence depicted, banned in several countries, and was implicated in a murder by the UK media, although this accusation was later rejected by the police and courts. Manhunt spawned the sequel Manhunt 2 in 2007, with new characters and a new story. As of March 2008, the Manhunt series has collectively sold 1.7 million copies.
