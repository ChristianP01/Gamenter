Titolo: Konpeki no Kantai

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Konpeki no Kantai (紺碧の艦隊, literally "Deep Blue Fleet") is a Japanese alternate history series produced by J.C.Staff. The series focuses on both a technologically-advanced Imperial Japanese Navy and a radically-different World War II that were brought about by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's revival by unexplained circumstances. The original video animation (OVA) series is also notable for using the Imperial Japanese calendar, instead of the Western calendar, in denoting the years in which the events of the series take place. It also spawned a 1997 OVA side story, Kyokujitsu no Kantai (旭日の艦隊, literally "Fleet of the Rising Sun"), one manga sequel, and two turn-based strategy games for the PC-FX and the Super Famicom.
Konpeki no Kantai is based on a novel series written by Yoshio Aramaki, whose first volume was published in December 1990. The novel's popularity reportedly rose dramatically because of the start of the Gulf War the following month. Aramaki later wrote a different series, Kyokujitsu no Kantai (旭日の隊) (literally "Fleet of the Rising Sun"), elements of which were used in the OVA sequel. Both series eventually sold more than five million copies.  
Between 1997 and 2000, Aramaki wrote two sequel series: Shin Konpeki no Kantai (新・紺碧の艦隊, 9 volumes) and Shin Kyokujitsu no Kantai (新・旭日の艦隊, 18 volumes).
The title is a reference to the series depicting an advanced submarine force.
