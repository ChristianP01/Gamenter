Titolo: Magical Chase

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Magical Chase is a 1991 horizontally scrolling shooter video game developed by Quest and published by Palsoft and Turbo Technologies Inc. for the TurboGrafx-16. The game stars a young witch apprentice named Ripple, who broke a promise to her teacher by accidentally releasing six demons from a forbidden book, joined by her star companions Topsy and Turvy on a quest to catch and seal the demons back into the book.
Magical Chase was created by most of the same team at Quest that would go to work on Ogre Battle and Final Fantasy Tactics. The game was released in Japan in 1991 amid Palsoft's closure, resulting in a low print run before being re-released by Japanese magazine PC Engine Fan via mail order. It was graphically altered for its late 1993 North American release at the end of the TurboGrafx-16's lifecycle. It is considered by gaming journalists as one of the rarest, most valuable and sought-after TurboGrafx titles.
Magical Chase was met with positive reception from critics since its initial launch; it was praised for its colorful cartoon-like presentation, graphical effects, lack of slowdown, sound and gameplay. Retrospective commentary has been positive, with praise given to the use of parallax scrolling that pushed the TurboGrafx-16 to its limits. It was ported to Microsoft Windows in 1998 and Game Boy Color in 2000.
