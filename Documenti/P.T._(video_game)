Titolo: P.T. (video game)

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: P.T. (initialism for "playable teaser") is a psychological horror game developed by Kojima Productions, under the pseudonym "7780s Studio", and published by Konami. It was directed and designed by Hideo Kojima, in collaboration with filmmaker Guillermo del Toro.
Released for the PlayStation 4 on 12 August 2014 as a free download on the PlayStation Network, P.T. served as an interactive teaser for the game Silent Hills, an installment in the Silent Hill series. After Konami cancelled Silent Hills, Konami removed P.T. from the PlayStation Store and made it impossible to reinstall. The decision prompted criticism, fan efforts to allow P.T. to be re-downloaded, and fan remakes.
P.T. received acclaim for its direction, visuals, story complexity, and its supernatural horror tension build, while its puzzles drew mixed responses.
