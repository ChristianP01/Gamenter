Titolo: Kid Vid Grid

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Kid Vid Grid is a tile-matching full motion video puzzle game developed by Geffen Records and published by Jasmine Multimedia Publishing for Windows in 1994. It is a spin-off of the original Vid Grid, which was released on the same year, and is it also the second entry in the franchise of the same name.
In the game, the main objective of the players is to resolve and finish a jigsaw puzzle on time before the video clip that is being played on the background ends. Produced by series creator Norman Beil, Kid Vid Grid is mainly themed after cartoons and prominently features characters from animated series by Hanna-Barbera such as Huckleberry Hound and Snagglepuss unlike the original Vid Grid, which had a heavy emphasis on rock music combining multiple genres and subgenres.
