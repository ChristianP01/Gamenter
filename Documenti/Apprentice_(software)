Descrizione: Apprentice is a program that assists in playing Magic: The Gathering over the Internet and maintains a searchable database of Magic cards.  It was developed by Dragonstar Studios from 1996 to 1999 and based on an earlier program from 1995 by Tan Thor Jen.  Christopher Warden, owner of Dragonstar Studios, acquired the source code for the original 1995 Apprentice, which was written in Visual Basic. It was then ported to Delphi by Mike Allen and after creation of the 1.0 port development was continued by Ryan Davis. The last release was in the version 1.4 branch and a 2.0 branch, developed by Davis, was promised in the future.  However, Dragonstar Studios disbanded. In 2007 Apprentice 2.0 was open sourced on SourceForge. In 2012 Apprentice started being updated again, with a new website created.
