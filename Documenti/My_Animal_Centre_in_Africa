Titolo: My Animal Centre in Africa

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: My Animal Centre in Africa is a video game for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS and Windows developed by German studio Braingame. It is similar to the game Pawly Pets: My Animal Hospital, except the player can look after different animals. The main character is a veterinarian, with an optional name, date of birth and place of birth. The title of the clinic is also optional. In the game, the goal is to look after wild African animals that are brought into the player's clinic by the gamekeeper. Like the game Pawly Pets: My Animal Hospital, there are three different difficulty levels; easy, medium and hard. Players will need to reach certain goals to advance to the next level, whereas in an open ended game, players can build enclosures as they wish. Some animals with problems can't be released into the wild, and so they must be looked after.
The game was created to be child-friendly, so when an animal is brought in, it doesn't act vicious or have any injuries. The game can teach people about wild African animals, and the medical problems that they can have.
