Descrizione: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is a tactical shooter video game and the first in the Rainbow Six series. It was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment in 1998 for Microsoft Windows. It was ported to Mac OS, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Game Boy Color.
In single-player, the player advances through a series of scenarios by playing missions in a campaign. Every mission initializes with a briefing stage, allowing the player to choose their equipment, coordinate their attacks, and develop the plot. Throughout each mission the player directly controls one team member, and can take control of any living operative. However, any casualties cannot be used in future missions unless the mission is reset. In multiplayer, the game pits two teams of players against each other in order to complete objectives depending on the game mode.
Rainbow Six received positive reviews from critics on PC, praised for its representation of audio and its immersive feeling, despite being a very difficult game. However, the console versions received lower ratings. In its first year of release it sold over 200,000 copies, accounting to $8.86 million in revenue.
An expansion pack, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Mission Pack: Eagle Watch, was released on January 31, 1999. On October 29, 2018, Sony revealed that the PAL release of the game would be one of 20 games pre-loaded on the PlayStation Classic (excluding Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong), which was released on December 3, 2018.
