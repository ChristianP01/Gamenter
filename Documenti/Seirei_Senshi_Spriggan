Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Seirei Senshi Spriggan is a 1991 vertically scrolling shooter video game developed by Compile  and published by Naxat Soft in Japan for the PC Engine CD-ROM².  In the game, the player assume control of Jega and Rikart piloting the Spriggan in order to protect their country from the Buraizubara empire.
Seirei Senshi Spriggan was created for "Summer Carnival", an event hosted by Naxat Soft similar to Hudson Soft's "All-Japan Caravan Festival", by staff at Compile who previously worked on the Aleste series. The game was originally intended for the Sega Mega Drive but switched instead to PC Engine due to demand from players for Compile to make a shooter game for the platform. The team came up with a fantasy-theme title to differentiate it from MUSHA. It was announced as part of the Aleste series under the working title Seirei Senshi Aleste but its name changed several times prior to launch. Though initially launched for the PC Engine platform, Spriggan was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console and later included as part of the PC Engine Mini console in its western variants, marking its first official appearance in North American and European regions. An English localization was slated to be published by Working Designs but it never released.
Seirei Senshi Spriggan garnered positive reception from critics since its release on the PC Engine CD-ROM², most of which reviewed it as an import title; praise was given to the overall presentation, rich and colorful visuals, variety of stages, weapon system, controls and gameplay. Retrospective commentary has been positive.
