Titolo: City Connection

Anno: 1985

Descrizione: City Connection is a 1985 platform arcade game developed and published by Jaleco. It was released in North America by Kitkorp as Cruisin'. The player controls Clarice in her Honda City hatchback and must drive over elevating roads to paint them. Clarice is constantly under pursuit by police cars, which she can take out by launching oil cans at them, temporarily stunning them, and then ramming into them with her car. Jaleco was inspired by maze chase action titles like Pac-Man (1980) and Crush Roller (1981) while designing the game.
City Connection was ported to several platforms, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). In Japan, the game has maintained a loyal following, with the NES version being seen as a classic for the platform. It has since been re-released through several Jaleco game collections and services such as the Wii Virtual Console. These versions attracted more mixed responses in North America, with critics disliking its simplicity, lack of replay value, and poor controls. Some felt it possessed a cute aesthetic and unique concept, and was entertaining to play. Jaleco produced a sequel named City Connection Rocket for Japanese mobile phones in 2004. The game is credited for having one of the first female protagonists in a console game.
