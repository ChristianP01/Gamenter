Descrizione: Marvel's Iron Man VR is a virtual reality shooter video game developed by American studios Camouflaj and Darkwind Media and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4's PlayStation VR headset. It is based on the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man, and is inspired by the long-running comic book mythology and adaptations in other media. The game's story revolves around Iron Man's conflict with a mysterious computer hacker and terrorist known only as Ghost, who targets Tony Stark and his company while seeking revenge for the deaths caused by the weapons the company manufactured prior to Stark becoming Iron Man.
Gameplay is presented from a first-person perspective, calling on the player to navigate the game's virtual space by using the flying mechanics and weapon systems of the Iron Man armor to attack enemies primarily in aerial combat across several environments. Iron Man can freely navigate the different environments in the game accessed through a linear progression of different levels, interacting with characters, undertaking missions, and unlocking new armor upgrades by progressing through the main story or completing challenge modes outside of the story.
After a series of delays and a disruption in the game's production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the game was released for PlayStation VR on July 3, 2020. The game received "mixed or average" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.
