Titolo: Bible Adventures

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Bible Adventures is a Christian video game by Wisdom Tree first released in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and ported to the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1995. The game was unusual in that it was never sold in video game outlets. It contains three different games: Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, and David and Goliath, all of which are based rather loosely on stories from the Bible. The gameplay of these games is sidescroller style similar to that of Super Mario Bros. 2 for the NES. The game also features Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring, by J. S. Bach, as the background music for the title screen.  The game bypasses the 10NES lockout chip by emitting a voltage spike when the NES control deck is turned on.
