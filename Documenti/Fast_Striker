Titolo: Fast Striker

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Fast Striker is a video game developed and published by German developer NG:Dev.Team in 2010 for the Neo Geo MVS. The player flies a space fighter craft through vertically scrolling levels to shoot waves of enemies. The game was later ported to Dreamcast, iOS, Neo Geo AES, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.
Fast Striker was developed in conjunction with HUCAST's DUX over the course of six years after the Hellwig brothers founded NG:Dev.Team and development of their first video game, Last Hope, was completed. The team went with a different approach for their vertical-scrolling shooter project compared to the level memorization focus of Last Hope, emphasising fast-paced reflex action and an elaborate scoring system. The staff also received support from German shooter communities during beta testing, advising from Twinkle Star Sprites designer Yoshiyasu Matsushita and approval from SNK Playmore.
Fast Striker was met with mixed reception from critics. Reviewers praised its fast action, scoring system, techno soundtrack, speed, and adjustable difficulty levels that alters each playthrough but others criticized the gameplay, monochrome visual style, pacing and short length, as well as the lack of additional options on the PlayStation versions.
