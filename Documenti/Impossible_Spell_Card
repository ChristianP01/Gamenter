Descrizione: Danmaku Amanojaku ~ Impossible Spell Card. (Japanese: 弾幕アマノジャク ～ Impossible Spell Card.) is a vertical scrolling shooter and the 14.3rd official game of the Touhou Project series. It was first released in the 11th Hakurei Shrine Reitaisai on May 11, 2014.  It released on Steam on April 1, 2019. The player controls Seija Kijin, the main character, to take down bosses and avoid the bullets.

All levels in Impossible Spell Card may be completed without the use of items, however.
