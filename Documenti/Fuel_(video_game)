Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Fuel is an open world racing video game developed by Asobo Studio and published by Codemasters. The game was released in 2009 in North America on June 2 and Europe on June 5 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and July 5 for Microsoft Windows. It is set in a post-apocalyptic United States after the Sun scorched the Earth, with a completely free-to-roam open world approximately 5,560 square miles (14,400 km2) in size, which is roughly the size of the U.S. state of Connecticut. In the free roaming mode, the game features the ability to drive anywhere in the game world without incurring loading times; however, crashing a vehicle – or invoking the reset function to return to the road – does invoke a loading screen.
