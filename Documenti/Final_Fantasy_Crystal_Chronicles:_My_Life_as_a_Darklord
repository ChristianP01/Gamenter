Descrizione: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a Darklord is a 2009 tower defense video game developed and published by Square Enix for the Wii and distributed through the WiiWare download service. The game is an entry in the Final Fantasy franchise, forming part of the Crystal Chronicles subseries. Taking place after Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King, the game follows the titular Darklord as she defends her mobile tower from waves of attacks as it travels across the kingdom.
Planned during production of My Life as a King, My Life as a Darklord began development in 2008. The game's aesthetic was influenced by lolita gothic and punk fashion. The narrative, and the protagonist, were designed to subvert both series and genre conventions. Composer Kumi Tanioka returned, having previously worked on the other Crystal Chronicles titles. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics generally praising the game's gameplay and presentation while critiquing a lack of in-game depth.
