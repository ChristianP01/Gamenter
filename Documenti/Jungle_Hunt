Titolo: Jungle Hunt

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Jungle King, re-released as Jungle Hunt, is an action game developed by Taito and released for arcades in 1982. It was originally distributed as Jungle King, then quickly modified and re-released as Jungle Hunt due to a copyright dispute over the player character's likeness to Tarzan. Jungle King, along with Moon Patrol released a month earlier, is one of the first video games with parallax scrolling.
The player controls an unnamed character moving through side-scrolling scenes to rescue a woman from cannibals by swinging from vine to vine, swimming a crocodile-infested river, and avoiding rolling rocks. In the original Jungle King release, the loincloth-wearing character resembles Tarzan. In the rebranded Jungle Hunt, the player character is an explorer, sporting a pith helmet and safari suit. Another re-theming of the arcade version was distributed as Pirate Pete in 1982.
Home versions of Jungle Hunt were published by Atari, Inc., sometimes under the Atarisoft label, for Apple II, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, VIC-20, and IBM PC compatibles.
