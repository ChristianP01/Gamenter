Titolo: The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes is an action-adventure game developed by Nintendo EPD and Grezzo and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS. The second original Nintendo 3DS entry in The Legend of Zelda series after A Link Between Worlds, this game is the third installment in the franchise to prominently feature a multiplayer campaign after Four Swords and Four Swords Adventures, albeit this time with only three players as opposed to four, wireless and online connectivity as opposed to the prior games' use of link cables, and a stronger emphasis on cooperation rather than competition. The story follows the same incarnation of Link from the aforementioned A Link Between Worlds, who this time is called forth along with two other Links by the fashion-obsessed kingdom of Hytopia to lift a curse placed on their princess, Styla, from the evil Drablands Witch. It was released worldwide in October 2015 to mixed-to-positive reviews.
