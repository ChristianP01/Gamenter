Descrizione: Mystik Belle is an independent platform video game by American developer Andrew Bado and released on the Steam storefront on May 15, 2015.  Ports for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were released on October 3, 2017, published by WayForward Technologies, known for their similar Shantae series. WayForward also expressed interest in porting the game for Nintendo Switch once GameMaker Studio integration is implemented on the console.
