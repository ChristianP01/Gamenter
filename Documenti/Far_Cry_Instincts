Titolo: Far Cry Instincts

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Far Cry Instincts is a 2005 first-person shooter game developed and published by Ubisoft for the Xbox. A remake of the original Microsoft Windows version of Far Cry, Instincts is less open-ended and more linear, due to the console's reduced processing power which prevents the full rendering of the Windows version's vast islands and landscape. However, Instincts adds new multiplayer modes, weapons, and 'feral abilities', the latter being reflected in the modified storyline. Ports of the game for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube were also planned, but were ultimately cancelled. Instincts received generally positive reviews from critics.
A sequel, Far Cry Instincts: Evolution, was released for the Xbox in 2006. Far Cry Instincts: Predator, a compilation of Instincts and Evolution for the Xbox 360, was released alongside Evolution. An arcade version of Instincts developed by Global VR was released in 2007 under the title Paradise Lost.
