Titolo: Hidden Runaway

Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Hidden Runaway is a 2012 hidden object game developed by the Spanish company Pendulo Studios and published by Bulkypix. It follows protagonists Brian Basco and Gina Timmins as they retell events from Runaway: A Road Adventure (2001) to a film producer interested in their life story. Along the way, the player plays minigames and searches for objects hidden in the game's environments. Hidden Runaway marked a departure for Pendulo, as it was the company's first casual game and first project outside the graphic adventure game genre.
Hidden Runaway was developed during a difficult economic period for Pendulo, and the game was itself a commercial failure. It remained Pendulo's worst-selling title by 2016 and contributed to a financial decline at the company. Critical reviews for Hidden Runaway were "mixed or average", according to Metacritic. Following Hidden Runaway, Pendulo stopped releasing original games for several years, until it returned with Yesterday Origins in 2016.
