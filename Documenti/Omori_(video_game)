Titolo: Omori (video game)

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Omori (stylized as OMORI) is a 2020 role-playing video game developed by indie studio Omocat.  Based on the director's Omori (ひきこもり, hikikomori) webcomic series, it was released in December 2020. Prominently featuring concepts such as anxiety and depression, the game has psychological horror elements. In the story, the player controls a hikikomori boy named Sunny and his dream world alter-ego Omori. They explore both the real world and the surreal dream world to overcome their fears and secrets. How they interact depends on choices made by the player, resulting in one of several endings. The game's turn-based battle system includes unconventional status effects based on the characters' emotions.
After a successful Kickstarter campaign, the game was delayed numerous times, and experienced several development difficulties. It was finally released for Microsoft Windows and macOS six years after its initial funding, and the developers also announced plans for a Japanese translation as well as ports to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Omori was acclaimed by critics, who lauded it for its graphics, narrative elements, soundtrack, and depiction of anxiety and depression, favorably comparing it to EarthBound and Yume Nikki.  The game went on to be nominated for several awards, winning DreamHack's "Daringly Dramatic" category in 2021.
