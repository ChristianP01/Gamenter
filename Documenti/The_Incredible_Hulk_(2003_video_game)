Descrizione: The Incredible Hulk is a 2003 beat 'em up video game developed by Pocket Studios and published by Universal Interactive for the Game Boy Advance. The game, featuring an isometric perspective, is based on the Marvel Comics superhero Hulk, who must traverse through a series of levels and destroy enemies with an assortment of physical attacks; a multiplayer mode in which players battle against each other is also featured.
The game was released simultaneously alongside the console and Microsoft Windows title Hulk to coincide with the release of the film, but differs from its counterpart in its basis on the comics rather than the film. Critical reception to the game was mixed; while the visuals were commended, the gameplay, controls, and audio were criticized, and reactions to the multiplayer mode were divided.
