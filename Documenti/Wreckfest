Titolo: Wreckfest

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Wreckfest is a racing video game developed by Bugbear Entertainment and published by THQ Nordic. Wreckfest is described as the spiritual successor to the FlatOut series and a cross between FlatOut, Destruction Derby and cult 1989 PC racer Street Rod. A notable feature of the game engine is the use of soft-body damage modelling, which enables location-based damage that affects the driving dynamics of vehicles in a realistic fashion. After a four-year long early access phase (during which, the game was called Next Car Game), the Microsoft Windows version was released in June 2018, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions released on August 27, 2019 after multiple delays. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions were released on June 1, 2021. A Nintendo Switch version of the game is set to release in Q4 2021.
