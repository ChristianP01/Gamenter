Titolo: CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder is a computer game based on the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation television series. Unlike the previous CSI games, this game was developed by Telltale Games, rather than 369 Interactive. It was published by Ubisoft, and was released for Microsoft Windows in March 2006.
The game uses a new 3D engine, which changes the gameplay and graphical look of the game, in comparison to 369 Interactive's CSI games.
This game, like the previous CSI games CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and CSI: Miami, follows a distinct pattern of five cases, with the fifth case tying together the previous four.
A PlayStation 2 version of this game was released on the September 25, 2007 in the United States. This version was made by Ubisoft's studio in Sofia, Bulgaria. The PlayStation 2 version is not the same as the Microsoft Windows version. The player has free movement and control of the view, which was required by Sony America. This change created extraordinary difficulties for the developer.
