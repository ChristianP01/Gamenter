On 26 March 2019, Chinese studio Yoozoo Games announced the global launch of Game of Thrones Winter is Coming, a real-time strategy browser game officially licensed by Warner Bros, under license from HBO. The version of the game for Steam was released on November 19, 2019 and the mobile port was released on July 20, 2020.The player takes the part of a lord or lady of one of the seven kingdoms of Westeros, and progresses by training soldiers, recruiting characters and forming an alliance with other players.Advertisements for this game that intruded into YouTube videos, seemed to say that game activities include not only fighting and war, but also increasing food production (cultivating land, herding sheep, fishing, picking fruit), mining metal ore, having weapons made, felling timber and making buildings, and training men. Picking fruit, cultivating land, fishing and herding sheep are not a part of the actual gameplay.
In the game, a dragon can be obtained, as an egg, which can be hatched, and the hatchling can be raised through its juvenile stage to being big enough to be useful in battle and air-search.
In the story's timeline, the game starts after Eddard Stark dies, but as if all seven kingdoms had thereupon seceded, not only The North.
