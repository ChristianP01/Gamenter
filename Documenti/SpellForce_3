Descrizione: SpellForce 3 is a 2017 video game developed by Grimlore Games and published by THQ Nordic. It was released for Microsoft Windows on 7 December 2017. SpellForce 3 is the third full and the ninth overall release in the SpellForce video game series. It is the first entry in the series since 2014's SpellForce 2: Demons of the Past. The plot serves as a prequel to the first game (SpellForce: The Order of Dawn), depicting events that lead to the creation of The Circle, the group of mages whose actions were the basis for The Order of Dawn.
The game combines role-playing and real-time strategy elements like previous games in the series. Players control a mage called Tahar and a group of supporting characters with different backstories and abilities. Like many role-playing games, characters can equip various items such as armor, weapons and jewelry that influence the character's abilities and traits. Many maps allow players to construct buildings and gather resources to create additional units with fixed abilities. The game features an extensive campaign that can be played by a single player or two players. It also includes a skirmish mode allowing players to battle against the AI or other players, independently of the campaign.
Two standalone expansions were released for SpellForce 3, Soul Harvest (2018) and Fallen God (2020), as well as a free multiplayer-only version called SpellForce 3: Versus. On 6 December 2021, an upgraded version of the original, SpellForce 3 Reforced was released for Microsoft Windows, and due to release for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 8 March 2022.
