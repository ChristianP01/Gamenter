Descrizione: Dragon Age: Origins – Return to Ostagar is a downloadable content (DLC) pack for the 2009 fantasy role-playing video game Dragon Age: Origins developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. It was digitally released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows between January to March 2010. The pack follows the surviving members of the Grey Warden branch in the kingdom of Ferelden in Thedas, the setting of the Dragon Age franchise. The Wardens return to the ruined fortress of Ostagar in the aftermath of a great battle between its defenders and an invading force of monstrous Darkspawn which takes place during an early sequence in Origins, which resulted in the deaths of Ferelden's king as well as the entirety of the Grey Warden leadership.
 Return to Ostagar is the first post-launch single-player narrative content pack for Dragon Age: Origins. It received a mixed reception from video game publications, with praise for the exploration of backstory and lore around the Battle of Ostagar, a pivotal moment in the franchise's in-universe narrative, as well as criticism for its perceived lack of value for money and shallow gameplay content. The content pack's troubled release schedule have also received significant coverage.
