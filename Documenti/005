It is one of the first examples of a stealth game. In this "James Bond-inspired" game, the player's mission is to take a briefcase of secret documents to a waiting helicopter. The player controls a spy who must avoid the enemies as he makes his way through buildings and warehouses, where he will have to dodge the enemies' flashlights and use boxes as hiding spots.
