Titolo: The Dagger of Amon Ra

Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Roberta Williams' Laura Bow in The Dagger of Amon Ra (also known as Laura Bow II) is a computer game published by Sierra On-Line in 1992. The game is the second and final installment in the Laura Bow Mysteries line of adventure games, the first of which was The Colonel's Bequest. Unlike the first game, it was not written or designed by Roberta Williams, but she was a creative consultant on the project. It uses 8-bit color and a point-and-click interface. The CD-ROM version included voice acting. The Dagger of Amon Ra was developed using Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI1.1). Overall, this sequel owes little to the original game and is a much more traditional point-and-click game. It was re-released in 2017 on GOG.com with modern Windows support.
