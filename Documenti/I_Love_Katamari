Descrizione: I Love Katamari (塊魂モバイル, Katamari Damashii Mobairu, lit. "Clump Spirit Mobile"), also known as i Love Katamari, is a third-person puzzle-action video game developed by Namco Bandai Games for iOS. It is a continuation of the Katamari Damacy series of games. It was released worldwide in the App Store on December 14, 2008 (2008-12-14) (and subsequently removed on March 30, 2015 (2015-03-30)). In 2010 Namco announced a Windows Phone 7 version of the game. A version was released for Android in 2012 exclusively for Samsung Android devices. In this game, the King of All Cosmos instructs the game's protagonist – the Prince – to gather as many objects as possible to grow a highly adhesive ball called a Katamari large enough so that he can pick up special objects to bring to the King so that he can regain his memory.The gameplay is identical to that of Katamari Damacy, where the player rolls a highly adhesive ball called a Katamari, collecting various objects of increasing size until it becomes large enough to transform into a star. The game utilizes the specialized technology from the iPhone and iPod Touch in which players tilt the device to move the Katamari across the playing field. I Love Katamari received mixed reviews. While it has been praised for its game presentation, it has also been criticized for performance and control issues. The performance and control issues were improved in an update, but not entirely fixed. As of 2018 the game has been delisted from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, though it is not available on the Windows Store, the page for it is still active.
