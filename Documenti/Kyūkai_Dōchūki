Titolo: Kyūkai Dōchūki

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Kyūkai Dōchūki is a baseball arcade game that was released by Namco in 1990 in Japan; it runs on Namco System 2 hardware, and is a spin-off of Yokai Dochuki. The gameplay is similar to that for Namco's own World Stadium series - except that both players have a total of thirty-six different teams to choose from in the Japanese, Arabic, German, Humbaba, American, Russian, and Chinese leagues. The Japan League has five stadiums, and if the first player selects one team from it, it will randomly decide which one the match will take place in; however, the other leagues only have one stadium, This game also features a cameo re-appearance, from Valkyrie (as in no Densetsu), who appears to report the final outcome of a match once it has finished, and Namco's signature character Pac-Man can also be seen on two of the television screens in her studio wearing a purple bow tie (in his Pac-Land-style anthropomorphized form, as opposed to his "original" one).
