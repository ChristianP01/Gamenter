Titolo: Dino Stalker

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Dino Stalker is a horror light gun shooter video game developed by Capcom Production Studio 3 and published by Capcom exclusively for the PlayStation 2. It is an offshoot of the Resident Evil light gun shooter games, but based on the story of the Dino Crisis series. Though it can be played by other means, a light gun is recommended, as the game is one in a number of Capcom games that try to bridge the gap between light gun games and traditional games that allow the player greater range of control over their movements in the game.Dino Stalker is the third entry in the Capcom's Gun Survivor series after Resident Evil Survivor 2 â€“ Code: Veronica. Although the Gun Survivor games are an offshoot of the Resident Evil series, Dino Stalker is the only game in the series without any ties to Resident Evil (with the exception of two easter eggs in Stage 5, one involving the "woman drawing water" statue from the mansion in the first game, and an Umbrella building). It was followed by Resident Evil: Dead Aim.
