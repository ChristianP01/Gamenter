Descrizione: GioGio's Bizarre Adventure, known in Japan as JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken: Ōgon no Kaze, is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 2 on July 25, 2002 in Japan. It is based on Golden Wind, the fifth part of Hirohiko Araki's manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The player controls characters from the manga, and fight enemies in 3D environments using both physical attacks, and special combination moves performed by spirit-like "Stand" characters released from the player character's body.
To recreate the art style used in the manga, Capcom developed a graphics technique called Artistoon, with which the game renders cel-shaded graphics; additionally, Araki's art was featured in the game. Capcom planned to release the game in North America and Europe, but after delays, it ended up not getting released outside Japan. Critics praised the game's visuals and presentation, commenting on how it recreated the look of the manga well, while the gameplay was met by mixed opinions.
