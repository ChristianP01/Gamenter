Descrizione: Pico Park is an action-puzzle game developed by the indie game studio Tecopark. It is a multiplayer game dedicated to playing with friends, parents, and children. Teco, the developer of the game, made the game with an objective of cooperating with a large number of people. The first release of Pico Park was in 2016 for Microsoft Windows and was available for purchase online via video game retailer Steam, featuring local multiplayer gameplay. The game was formerly named "Picollecita" but was changed to Pico Park because the pronunciation was too hard.

There are a total of 3 modes that players can chose: World mode, Endless mode, and Battle mode. In 'World mode', players need to cooperate to solve the puzzle. In 'Endless mode' players cooperate to achieve a high score, and 'Battle mode' is where players need to compete with each other to win the game.
