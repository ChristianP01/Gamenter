Titolo: Frogs (video game)

Anno: 1978

Descrizione: Frogs is a single-player action arcade game released by Gremlin in 1978. It notably featured a jumping character (predating Donkey Kong by 3 years). The game's graphics are "projected" by laying the monitor flat on its back and reflecting the computer-generated graphics of the frogs and flies toward the player via a mirror at a 45-degree angle. (The game's graphics were actually generated and shown backward, so the mirror reflection would show letters and numbers properly.) The game was distributed by Sega in Japan.
