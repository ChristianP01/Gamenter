Titolo: The Amazing Spider-Man: Web of Fire

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: The Amazing Spider-Man: Web of Fire is a side-scrolling action-adventure video game developed by BlueSky Software and published by Sega exclusively for the 32X add-on in North America in March 1996. Based on the popular Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man, it is inspired by the long-running comic book mythology and adaptations in other media. In the main storyline, the terrorist organization H.Y.D.R.A. and the New Enforcers orchestrate a plot to shroud New York City under an electrical plasma grid, trapping its citizens. Spider-Man must confront each of the New Enforcers members, foil Hydra's plans, and save the city with the aid of Daredevil.
Headed by co-producers Jerry Huber and Jerry Markota, Spider-Man: Web of Fire was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at BlueSky Software such as Vectorman and its sequel. It was the last game released for the 32X platform in North America after Sega discontinued support for the add-on, who produced a limited run of copies in total as a result. The title received mixed reception from the few video game magazines and gaming-dedicated outlets that covered the game, with critics divided in regards to aspects such as presentation, visuals, audio, controls and gameplay. It served as the final Marvel Comics-licensed release by Sega until 2008's Iron Man.
