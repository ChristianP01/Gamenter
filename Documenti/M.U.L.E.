Titolo: M.U.L.E.

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: M.U.L.E. is a seminal multiplayer video game written for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers by Ozark Softscape. Designer Danielle Bunten Berry (credited as Dan Bunten) took advantage of the four joystick ports of the Atari 400 and 800 to allow four-player simultaneous play. M.U.L.E.  was one of the first five games published in 1983 by new company Electronic Arts, alongside Axis Assassin, Archon: The Light and the Dark, Worms?, and Hard Hat Mack.  Primarily a turn-based strategy game, it incorporates real-time elements where players compete directly as well as aspects that simulate economics.
The game was ported to the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, and IBM PC (as a self-booting disk).  Japanese versions also exist for the PC-8801, Sharp X1, and MSX 2 computers. Like the subsequent models of the Atari 8-bit family, none of these systems allow four players with separate joysticks. The Commodore 64 version lets four players share joysticks, with two players using the keyboard during action portions.
