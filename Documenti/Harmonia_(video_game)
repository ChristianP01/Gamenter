Titolo: Harmonia (video game)

Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Harmonia is a Japanese post-apocalyptic visual novel developed by Key, a brand of VisualArt's. It was released on September 23, 2016 for Windows on Steam, and was available in English before its Japanese release on December 29, 2016. The story is set in a world where artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed before a rapid decline in human civilization. An emotionless young man named Rei with a mechanical right hand is cared for by a girl in a small town as he gradually learns how to express emotions.
Like Key's 2004 game Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet, Harmonia is defined as a "kinetic novel", since its gameplay offers no choices or alternate endings. Instead, the player proceeds through the story solely by reading. The story was written by Kai and Tsuzuru Nakamura, and character design was produced by Itaru Hinoue. The game's soundtrack was composed by Shinji Orito, Ry≈ç Mizutsuki and Tomohiro Takeshita. Harmonia was described as providing an emotional impact despite its short length, but was said to not be as impactful as other titles developed by Key.
