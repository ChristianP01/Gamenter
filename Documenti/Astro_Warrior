Titolo: Astro Warrior

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Astro Warrior (アストロウォリアー, Asutoro Uoriā) is a vertically scrolling shooter developed and manufactured by Sega for the Master System in 1986. Set in space, the player flies a spaceship shooting enemies and collecting power-ups to reach the mother ship of an invasion force. It was originally a bundled game that came with the console in Europe.
The game received positive reviews upon release, praising the graphics, weapons and large number of enemies; later retrospective reviews have been more mixed, with critics criticising the generic nature and lack of variety. The game was re-released on the Hang-On / Astro Warrior compilation in North America, and the Astro Warrior / Pit Pot compilation in Europe. In 1996, Tec Toy re-released the game in Brazil as Sapo Xulé: SOS Lagoa Poluída, and based it on a Brazilian 1980s toy. This version was also released in Portugal.
