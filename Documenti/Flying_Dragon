Descrizione: Flying Dragon, known in Japan as Hiryū no Ken Twin (飛龍の拳ツイン, Hiryū no Ken Tsuin, "Fist of the Flying Dragon Twin"), is a fighting game with role-playing video game elements that was developed by Culture Brain and released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998. Part of the Hiryū no Ken series, it was published in Japan by Culture Brain, and by Natsume in North America and Europe.
Its most notable feature was the game's SD mode that featured a character progression system, in which characters advance in levels as they become more experienced, and in which it is possible to collect credits and treasure items to equip characters with. The game received relatively low scores on specialized reviews at the time of its release. It had a sequel a year later, titled S.D. Hiryu no Ken Densetsu.
Flying Dragon is also the name of a NES game released by Culture Brain in 1989, which is part of the same series.
