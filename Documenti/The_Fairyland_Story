Titolo: The Fairyland Story

Anno: 1985

Descrizione: The Fairyland Story is a platform arcade game developed and published by Taito in 1985. In the game, the player controls the witch Ptolemy, with the objective being to clear the screen of all enemies. Ptolemy can use her wand to turn the enemies into large cakes, which she can then push off of platforms onto other enemies, which will squash them and award bonus points. Various Items that increase Ptolemy's projectile radius, as well as kill multiple enemies at the same time, will also appear throughout the stages.
Gameplay has often been compared to later Taito platform games, such as Bubble Bobble and The NewZealand Story. A Japanese MSX version developed and published by Hot-B was released in 1987, while a Sharp X68000 port was developed and published in 1991 by SPS. The Fairyland Story would be included in the arcade game collections Taito Legends 2, Taito Memories Jokan, Taito Memories Pocket, and Taito Legends Power-Up. A 2003 port for Japanese mobile phones was made available through the I-mode and EZweb network services. Around 2020, the game was later re-released on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 via Arcade Archives.
