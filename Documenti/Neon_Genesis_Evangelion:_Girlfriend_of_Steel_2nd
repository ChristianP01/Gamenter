Descrizione: Neon Genesis Evangelion: Girlfriend of Steel 2nd (新世紀エヴァンゲリオン鋼鉄のガールフレンド 2nd, Shinseiki Evangerion Kōtetsu no Gārufurendo 2nd, lit. "Neon Genesis Evangelion Girlfriend of Steel 2nd"), subtitled in English Neon Genesis Evangelion: Iron Maiden 2nd, is a Gainax-produced adventure anime-style video game, and manga based on that game, set in the alternate universe seen in episode 26 of Neon Genesis Evangelion.  The player controls Shinji Ikari, the hero of the original Evangelion series, as he navigates his home, school, and social life in a now-peaceful "Tokyo-3".
Each character from the original Evangelion makes an appearance but some of their circumstances and personalities have radically changed.  Misato Katsuragi is now a popular homeroom teacher, and Ritsuko Akagi is the school nurse (however, these two still have their posts at Nerv from the original storyline).  Asuka Langley Soryu is Shinji's childhood friend and neighbor, Kaworu Nagisa is an enigmatic playboy type who has known Shinji for years, and Rei Ayanami is a hyperactive transfer student.
Although the game's name suggests it is a sequel to the previous Evangelion visual novel Girlfriend of Steel, the story is unrelated, keeping only the gameplay. The game received a manga adaptation by Fumino Hayashi titled in English Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days.
