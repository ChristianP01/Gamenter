Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Jumpman  is a platform game written by Randy Glover and published by Epyx in 1983. It was first developed for the Atari 8-bit family, and versions were also released for the Commodore 64, Apple II, and IBM PC.
The game received very favorable reviews when it was released and was a major hit for its publisher, Automated Simulations. It was so successful that the company renamed itself Epyx, formerly their brand for action titles like Jumpman. Re-creations on other platforms, and new levels for the original versions, continue to appear.
Jumpman was published on diskette, but a version of the game with 12 new levels instead of 30 was released on  cartridge as Jumpman Junior. It was available on the Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, and ColecoVision.
