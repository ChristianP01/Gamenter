Titolo: Metroid: Other M

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Metroid: Other M is a 2010 action-adventure video game developed by Team Ninja and Nintendo SPD  and published by Nintendo for the Wii. It is part of the Metroid series, and takes place between the events of Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion. The player controls intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran, who investigates a derelict space station with a Galactic Federation platoon, including her former commanding officer, Adam Malkovich.
Longtime Metroid director Yoshio Sakamoto approached Team Ninja to develop Other M, while animation studio D-Rockets  handled the cutscenes. The development team employed a simple control scheme to make the game appealing to modern players, and gave significant focus on plot and characterization, with extensive cinematics and voice acting. Other M is played from a third-person perspective using only the Wii Remote, and focuses on exploration and combat. It introduces melee attacks which can only be executed when an enemy's health is reduced.
Metroid: Other M received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its elaborate cutscenes, graphics and action-oriented gameplay, although heavy criticism was directed at its narrative and Samus's characterization. The game also received honors from several publications. It was the third-best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release, and the ninth best-selling game in North America during September 2010. Metroid: Other M was re-released on the Wii U's Nintendo eShop in 2016. The Metroid series entered an extended hiatus following its release, not seeing a mainline entry until Metroid: Samus Returns in 2017.
