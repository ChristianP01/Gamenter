Titolo: Pokémon Puzzle League

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Pokémon Puzzle League is a 2000 puzzle video game developed for the Nintendo 64 by Nintendo Software Technology based on Nintendo's Puzzle League puzzle games with Pokémon likenesses. It was released in North America in 2000, and in Europe in 2001. Gameplay is similar to Puzzle League, with much of the focus being on puzzle-based strategy in the game's grid-based format. To advance to new levels, players are required to advance through the game's trainers and gym leaders, similar to the ones featured in Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow. It is one of several Pokémon games to be based on the Pokémon anime, and features Ash Ketchum and other characters featured from the anime.
As the development process of video games as a whole changed drastically from the 2D era of the fourth generation of video game consoles to the 3D era of the fifth generation, so did the development of Pokémon Puzzle League. The increased capabilities for artificial intelligence (AI) compelled the developers to create multiple levels of difficulty for the game, and it was implemented successfully in all but the 3D modes of the game, in which the AI becomes erratic at times. Local multiplayer capabilities are also available for one-on-one Puzzle League battles.
Pokémon Puzzle League received mostly positive reviews from critics. The game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console on May 5, 2008, in the North America region, and on May 30, 2008, in the European region.
