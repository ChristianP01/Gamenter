Titolo: Pac-Man Collection

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Pac-Man Collection is a 2001 video game compilation published by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. It includes four titles in the Pac-Man series — the original Pac-Man (1980), Pac-Mania (1987), Pac-Attack (1993), and Pac-Man Arrangement (1996), the last of which was originally exclusive to the arcade game Namco Classic Collection Vol. 2. Each game includes customizable features such as the ability to alter the number of starting lives or difficulty, with all being stripped of multiplayer features. Pac-Man, Pac-Mania and Arrangement were originally released for arcades, while Pac-Attack was first released for both the SNES and Sega Genesis.
Development of the game was headed by California-based studio Mass Media, who previously worked on several Namco Museum collections for other platforms. It was first announced on April 24, 2001 under the name Pac-Man Fever, before being presented at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) tradeshow. Pac-Man Collection was a commercial success — by 2007 it sold over 2.9 million copies worldwide, making it the ninth best-selling Game Boy Advance game of all time. Critics reacted positively to the title's selection of games and customizable features, although some criticized the exclusion of games such as Ms. Pac-Man and inability to save high-scores. It was re-released as a budget title in Japan in 2006, and later digitally on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014.
