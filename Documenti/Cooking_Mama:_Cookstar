Titolo: Cooking Mama: Cookstar

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Cooking Mama: Cookstar is a cookery simulation-styled minigame compilation video game, and the sixth installment in the Cooking Mama series of video games. The game was briefly released before its official release date on the Nintendo Switch eShop on March 26, 2020, but was taken down just a few hours later due to legal issues between the publisher, Planet Entertainment, and the owner of the Cooking Mama intellectual property (IP), Office Create. The game was then officially released on March 31 in the United States and March 30 in Australia despite legal concerns, but the European release was delayed to April 28. Office Create publicly issued a statement condemning the breach of contract on April 15, 2020. However, the European and Australian releases were not impacted and released as normal.
The game is the first entry in the Cooking Mama series since 2014's Cooking Mama 5: Bon App√©tit!, and the first Cooking Mama game on console since 2008's Cooking Mama: World Kitchen. It is also the first entry to be released on a non-Nintendo console, having been released on the PlayStation 4; this version was promoted alongside the original Switch release but was not released until over a year later.
