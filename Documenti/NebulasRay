Titolo: NebulasRay

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: NebulasRay is a vertical-scrolling shooter arcade game developed and released by Namco in 1994. Players take control of a starship named the Fighting Ray through a series of levels in its mission to eradicate the universe of an intergalactic organization named the Master Force. It is noteworthy for its usage of pre-rendering, where 3D models are converted into 2D sprites, creating the illusion of a 3D world.
NebulasRay was developed by the same team of Namco employees that created the vertical shooter Fighter & Attacker (1992). They chose to create another shooter because of their dissatisfaction with the quality of shooters at the time. The game was well-received, particularly for its graphical style. Reviewers also praised its gameplay, array of weapons, and soundtrack. Some felt it was hindered by its high difficulty level and similarity to other games.
