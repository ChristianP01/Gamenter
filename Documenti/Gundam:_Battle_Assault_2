Descrizione: Gundam: Battle Assault 2 is a 2002 fighting video game developed by Natsume for the PlayStation. Based on the Gundam franchise, it is a follow-up to Gundam: Battle Assault (1998). The story is divided into three storylines following a pilot from Mobile Fighter G Gundam, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing and Mobile Suit Gundam. Its gameplay consists of one-on-one fights, with a main six-button configuration, featuring special moves and two playable modes, while players can select any available mech to battle against enemies in story mode.
Gundam: Battle Assault 2 was developed for the North American audience by most of the same team at Natsume who previously worked on Gundam Wing: Endless Duel (1996) for Super Famicom and Battle Assault (1998) for PlayStation to build anticipation for Mobile Fighter G Gundam, which began airing on Cartoon Network in the United States via Toonami after Gundam Wing ended its run. The game was eventually released in Japan by D3 Publisher as part of the Simple Characters 2000 Series of budget-priced PlayStation games (as The Battle), split into two separate games: one focusing on G Gundam and the other on Gundam Wing.
Gundam: Battle Assault 2 was met with positive reception from critics. The game sold approximately 241,276 copies combined during its lifespan in Japan.
