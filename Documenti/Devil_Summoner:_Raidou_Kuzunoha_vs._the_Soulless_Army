Titolo: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army is an action role-playing game developed by Atlus for the PlayStation 2. The game is the third in the Devil Summoner series, which is a part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. It was published by Atlus in Japan and North America in 2006, and in Europe the following year.
The game differs from the two previous Devil Summoner titles in having real-time battles and a named protagonist and is first in the entire franchise to be set in the past – specifically the year 1931, the fictional twentieth year of the Taishō period of Japan, wherein it deals with historical figures such as Grigori Rasputin in addition to the Shin Megami Tensei series' traditional use of real-world mythological figures. Though somewhat criticized for being the shortest of recent games in the franchise, it generally received favorable reception. In April 2014, the game was ported to the PlayStation 3 on the PlayStation Store. A sequel, Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon, was released in 2008.
