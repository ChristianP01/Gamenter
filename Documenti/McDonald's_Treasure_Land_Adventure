Titolo: McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: McDonald's Treasure Land Adventure is a 1993 platform video game developed by Treasure and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. Based on the McDonald's fast food restaurant chain, specifically its McDonaldland marketing campaign, players control Ronald McDonald in his efforts to retrieve the missing pieces of a map that lead to the location of a buried treasure from a group of villains. Ronald can defeat enemies by using a magic attack and can latch onto hooks with his scarf to reach higher platforms.
Treasure Land Adventure was developed by Treasure in conjunction with the 'run and gun' platformer Gunstar Heroes (1993). Sega commissioned Treasure to design a McDonald's game after the company was ineligible to receive a publishing contract to develop games for the Genesis. Treasure president and project programmer Masato Maegawa mandated that the game had to be faithful and respectful to the McDonald's licensing and characters during production. Treasure Land Adventure, both at release and retrospectively, was praised for its gameplay and graphical style, and is cited as one of the better licensed games from the era. Some believed it lacked the same polish and hardware-pushing graphics as Treasure's other titles.
