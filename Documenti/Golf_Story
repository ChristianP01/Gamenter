Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Golf Story is a 2017 video game developed and published by Australian studio Sidebar Games for the Nintendo Switch. The game was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on 28 September 2017. Golf Story is an adventure game with role-playing (RPG) elements based on the sport of golf. Originally designed as a Wii U release, Golf Story had a lengthy development time, and Sidebar sought assistance from Nintendo to finish the game and release it for the Switch. It was influenced by the Game Boy Color version of Mario Golf, released in 1999.
The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's tone, story and characters but the RPG mechanics and lack of originality being less well received. The game was nominated for several awards and won the best original sports game at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards. A sequel, Sports Story, is currently in development for the Switch.
