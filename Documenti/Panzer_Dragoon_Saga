Titolo: Panzer Dragoon Saga

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Panzer Dragoon Saga, known in Japan as Azel: Panzer Dragoon RPG, is a 1998 role-playing video game developed by Team Andromeda and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn. It departs from the linear rail shooter gameplay of the Panzer Dragoon series, introducing RPG elements such as random encounters, semi-turn-based battles, and free-roaming exploration. The player controls Edge, a young mercenary who rides a dragon and encounters a mysterious girl from a vanished civilization.
Sega felt an RPG was critical to compete against the PlayStation and Final Fantasy. Development began in early 1995 alongside Panzer Dragoon II Zwei (1996). The project was arduous and repeatedly delayed; incorporating the series' shooting elements with full 3D computer graphics and voice acting, both unusual features in RPGs at the time, pushed the Saturn to its technical limits and strained team relations. Two staff members died during development, which director Yukio Futatsugi attributed to stressful working conditions.
Panzer Dragoon Saga is the most acclaimed Saturn game and is often listed as one of the greatest games of all time, earning praise for its story, graphics, and combat. As Sega had shifted focus to its Dreamcast console, it had a limited release in the west and worldwide sales were poor. Artist Katsumi Yokota attributed the low sales to the creative spirit of the team, who were not interested in creating a mainstream product.
Panzer Dragoon Saga has not been rereleased and English copies sell for hundreds of US dollars. After its release, Sega disbanded Team Andromeda; several staff members joined Sega's Smilebit studio and developed a fourth Panzer Dragoon game, Panzer Dragoon Orta (2002), for Xbox.
