Titolo: OneShot

Anno: 2016

Descrizione: OneShot is a puzzle and adventure indie game developed by Future Cat and published by Degica. Based on a 2014 free version, it was released for Steam on December 8, 2016, and on itch.io on March 12, 2020. Console ports were announced on December 8, 2021.
Officially described as a game where "the world knows you exist", both its gameplay and plot involve metafictional elements. Many puzzles involve interacting with the operating system outside of the game application. Narratively, the player is a separate character from the protagonist Niko; both arrive in a unfamiliar world which has been deprived of its sunlight, and eventually aim to restore it by replacing its sun, a lightbulb, at the top of a tower.
OneShot received largely positive reviews, with most reviewers praising its narrative and metafictional aspects, comparing it positively to other games such as Undertale. In 2017, the game was nominated for the "PC Game of the Year" Golden Joystick Award.
