Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Infamous: Festival of Blood is an action-adventure standalone downloadable content video game developed by Sucker Punch Productions for the PlayStation 3 video game console. Festival of Blood is an expansion in the Infamous series based on the Infamous 2 engine and map, but does not require a copy of Infamous 2 in order to play.The story is set aside from the canon aspect of the Infamous series, being a spoof told by the main protagonist's friend Zeke Dunbar and follows the story of Cole's gradual transformation into a vampire. The game features new characters and powers and a new comic cutscene creation for the main game Infamous 2's user-generated content (UGC), as well as support for the PlayStation Move controller. Unlike previous games, the game does not feature karmic choices on missions due to Cole's vampire state, and it does not penalize the player for killing civilians by drinking their blood.
Infamous: Festival of Blood – along with Infamous and Infamous 2 – was released on August 28, 2012, as part of the Infamous Collection under Sony's new line of PlayStation Collections for the PlayStation 3.
