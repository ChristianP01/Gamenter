Titolo: Scramble (video game)

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Scramble (スクランブル, Sukuranburu) is a side-scrolling shooter game released for arcades in 1981. It was developed by Konami, and manufactured and distributed by Leijac in Japan and Stern in North America. It was the first side-scrolling shooter with forced scrolling and multiple distinct levels, serving as a foundation for later side-scrolling shooters.
It was Konami's first major worldwide hit. In the United States, it sold 15,136 arcade cabinets within five months and became Stern's second best-selling game. Scramble was not ported to any major contemporary consoles or computers, but there were releases for the Tomy Tutor and Vectrex as well as dedicated tabletop/handheld versions. Several unauthorized clones for the VIC-20 and Commodore 64 used the same name as the original. Its sequel was the more difficult Super Cobra, release later the same year. The original Gradius (1985) was originally intended to be a follow-up to Scramble.
