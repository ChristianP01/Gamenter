Titolo: All Star Pro-Wrestling

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: All Star Pro-Wrestling is a Japan-exclusive professional wrestling video game developed and published by Square on June 8, 2000 for the PlayStation 2. It was the first wrestling game published on this platform.All Star Pro-Wrestling was released in a period in which Square sought to diversify its catalog by producing various non-role-playing games for the PlayStation 2. The game's control relied entirely on the DualShock 2's analog sticks, although a second mode using the normal buttons was also available.
While the quality of the game's graphics was lauded and sales were good during its month of release, the control was received negatively by critics, who felt it was awkward and unintuitive. Nevertheless, the game spawned two sequels, released in 2001 and 2003.
