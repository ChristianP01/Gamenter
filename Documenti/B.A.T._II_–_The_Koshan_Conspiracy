Descrizione: B.A.T. II – The Koshan Conspiracy is a futuristic point and click adventure game written by Computer's Dream and published by Ubi Soft in 1992. It is the sequel to the 1990 game B.A.T.
It is a futuristic role-playing game in which the player explores the city, talks to non-player characters, tries to solve puzzles, travels to new cities by use of a mini-game, buys weapons and ammo, engages in fire fights (also by way of a mini-game), buys a spaceship, and enters space. The player can even re-wire a wrist computer (B.O.B) in the game to perform different functions. It has a very open, non-linear play style.
The Amiga and Atari ST versions shipped with a physical dongle to prevent piracy.
The box art was painted by Luis Royo.
