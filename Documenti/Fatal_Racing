Descrizione: Fatal Racing, known as Whiplash in North America, is a 3D stunt car racing video game developed and published by Gremlin Interactive in Europe in 1995 for MS-DOS, and published in 1996 by Interplay Productions in North America.
In Fatal Racing the player picks among a broad selection of cars and drives through tracks with loops, corkscrews, and jumps while trying to smash into other cars to destroy them and at the same time cross the finish line first. There is a variety of different camera views available in the game, "in-car", chase-cam, etc. Multiplayer is supported by IPX/SPX network and modem, in addition, a split screen option is also available. Fatal Racing supports graphics resolutions of 320×200 and 640×480, the latter being very demanding on the hardware available at the time of the game's release. The game also runs in a 16:10 aspect ratio and not the more common 4:3 aspect ratio at the time.
The names displayed for drivers of cars in the race not controlled by human players all come from famous robot or computer characters from science fiction movies and television (Kryten and Holly from Red Dwarf, Slave from Blake's 7, Robby from Forbidden Planet, etc.). These names, however, are changeable and can be renamed within the configuration menu in the game.
