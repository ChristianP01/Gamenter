Titolo: Big Thinkers (video game series)

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Big Thinkers is a short line educational game from Humongous Entertainment, which revolved around siblings Ben and Becky Brightly (voiced by Mike Shapiro and Karen Kay Cody respectively), two characters with the ability to shape-shift into any object they desire. The series contains two games: Big Thinkers! Kindergarten and Big Thinkers! 1st Grade. Both titles feature the same goal of collecting stars. The title was conceived and developed by Jonathan Maier.
There were plans to release a third game in the series, Big Thinkers! 2nd Grade, which would have been released in 1998. It was initially developed in parallel with the other two games, but was abandoned when working on three games at once proved to be too ambitious and due to poor sales for the first two titles.
