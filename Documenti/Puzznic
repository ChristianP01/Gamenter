Titolo: Puzznic

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Puzznic (パズニック, Pazunikku) is a tile-matching puzzle video game developed and released by Taito for arcades in 1989. It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy, PC Engine, Sharp X68000, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, and ZX Spectrum between 1990 and 1991. Home computer ports were handled by Ocean Software; the 2003 PlayStation port was handled by Altron. The Japanese arcade and FM Towns versions had adult content, showing a naked woman at the end of the level; this was removed in the international arcade release and other home ports. A completed Apple IIGS version was cancelled after Taito America shut down.
Puzznic bears strong graphical and some gameplay similarities to Taito's own Flipull/Plotting.
