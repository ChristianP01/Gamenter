Titolo: Liberation: Captive 2

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Liberation: Captive 2 is an Amiga role-playing video game that was written by Byte Engineers and published by Mindscape in 1993. It is the sequel to Captive.
Although Liberation was released for the Amiga computer, it was one of the few titles developed primarily with the Amiga CD32 in mind. Specifically, it features long cut-scenes, voice acting, and a CD-quality soundtrack - the title of which has been re-recorded by the original composer for the Amiga Immortal 4 remix CD.
The game has some similarities with Hired Guns; both games have a dark cyberpunk setting. However, the object of Liberation is to find and free a prisoner by gathering clues and following leads. The game world is a very large city containing hundreds of fully explorable households, offices and public buildings. This vast setting precludes a brute force approach to finding the captive, and gives rise to the core gameplay element of detective work.
In line with its nominal classification as a role-playing video game, Liberation features typical role-playing tropes such as inventories, character upgrades, shops, money, and banks. Almost all world features are interactive: the libraries contain large volumes of real information the player must use, the police enforce the law and have working police stations and cells, the taxis are functional, and the player can deal drugs with the drug dealers.
