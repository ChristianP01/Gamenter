Anno: 2020

Descrizione: UnderMine is a roguelike action dungeon crawler video game developed and published by Thorium. It was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One on August 6, 2020, which followed an early access release in August 2019. It was released for Nintendo Switch on February 11, 2021, and for PlayStation 4 on March 30, 2021. 
In UnderMine, players control a series of procedurally generated player characters who are compelled to find their fortune in a dark and dangerous mine. During each run, players progress by descending through the mine's levels, exploring a procedurally generated series of rooms on each level, and gathering rewards. The player character must attempt to survive by defeating monsters in real-time combat and avoiding environmental hazards while collecting items and power-ups in order to defeat bosses. While the player's characters may often die as a result of being overcome by the game's challenges, half of the player's accumulated stash of gold as well as many unlocked equipment or upgrades are retained for use by a new character for the next run. Players may encounter and rescue non-player characters (NPC), who will then stay at the game's hub area to provide permanent upgrades or useful items for trade. 
UnderMine has been well-received. Critics praised its roguelike gameplay mechanics and dungeon crawling elements, and drew favorable comparisons to other games such as The Binding of Isaac and The Legend of Zelda series.
