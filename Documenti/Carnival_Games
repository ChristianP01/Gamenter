Titolo: Carnival Games

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Carnival Games (known in Europe and Australia as Carnival Funfair Games) is a video game for Nintendo's Wii home video game console and the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It was published by Global Star Software, before it was absorbed into Take-Two Interactive (and what is now 2K Play).
Despite mixed reviews by most gaming websites and critics, the game was a commercial success. The Wii and DS versions of the game have combined shipped over 7 million copies to date, which according to the NPD Group, is the third best-selling third-party game on the Wii.
As a result of the original's success, a follow-up for the Wii was announced, and launched in the fall of 2008, titled Carnival Games: Mini-Golf.  A proper sequel, New Carnival Games, was released on September 21, 2010 for the Wii and Nintendo DS. A new game for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, simply called Carnival Games, was released on November 6, 2018.
