Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Capcom Bowling is a top down bowling sports simulation game developed by Incredible Technologies (under the brand name Strata) and released by Capcom to arcades in 1988. Up to 4 four players could play a single game playing alternately. The controls feature a trackball which is used to control both direction and power, and two buttons which control left and right spin or hook. Comedic animations play for making certain shots.
The game was released in both an upright cabinet and a cocktail version. Most of the upright cabinets are conversion kits for existing cabinets although a limited number of dedicated cabinets were produced. These cabinets featured a birch plywood finish to mimic a bowling lane, a larger marbled trackball and painted side art. The Japanese version featured a different cabinet.
An alternate version, Coors Light Bowling, was released the following year. This version features endorsement from the beer drink Coors Light. The title screen is completely different on this version and some of the animations were changed to add Coors Light references.
