Titolo: Dark Age of Camelot

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Dark Age of Camelot is a 3D massively multiplayer online role-playing game released in October 2001 in North America and in January 2002 in Europe. The game combines Arthurian lore, Norse mythology, and Irish Celtic legends with high fantasy. It is set in the period after King Arthur's death, when his kingdom has split into three realms which are in a constant state of war with each other. Dark Age of Camelot includes both player versus environment (PvE) and realm versus realm (RvR) combat.
Developed by Mythic Entertainment, the game is in large part an adaptation of a previous text-based game called Darkness Falls: The Crusade (1999). On February 5, 2014, it was announced that development of Dark Age of Camelot would be transferred from Mythic Entertainment to Broadsword Online Games, a newly established studio, which also subsequently took over development of Mythic's other MMO game, Ultima Online. Mythic was shut down shortly thereafter, on May 29, 2014.In 2019, Broadsword announced that a new "progression" server was in development which would be limited to content from the original release, the Shrouded Isles expansion, and the housing zone additions. With regard to "Old Frontiers" returning to the game, the development team plans to poll the community for their preference.
