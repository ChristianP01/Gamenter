Descrizione: Battle-Girl is a 1997 multidirectional shooter video game developed by Ultra/United Games and originally published by Power Media for the Macintosh. In the game, players assume the role of the titular character taking control of her Soyuz 1183-A BattleCraft to save the Great Machine by eradicating malicious programmers released by Terminus, a weapon of Chaos. Its gameplay uses a two-joystick configuration reminiscent of Robotron: 2084.
Battle-Girl was co-designed over the course of almost two years by Scott Laing and Andrew Campbell, being influenced by various arcade games and most notably Tempest 2000, as the team at Ultra/United Games were fans of the Atari Jaguar. Although first launched for Macintosh, the game was ported to Microsoft Windows in 1998. The Mac OS version was re-released by Feral Interactive in 1999, with the addition of a physical demo released by Green Dragon Creations and Monkey Byte Online. The title garnered very positive reception from critics for its graphics, audio and gameplay.
