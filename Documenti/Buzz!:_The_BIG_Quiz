Descrizione: Buzz!: The BIG Quiz is the second in the Buzz! series of PlayStation 2 games developed by Relentless Software.
Initial promotional material had it named Buzz! The Uber Quiz, however Sony Computer Entertainment Europe announced the change upon the game's launch. The format is essentially that of the original: Buzz!: The Music Quiz. However, The Big Quiz covers an extensive range of general knowledge questions, including geography, history, sport, television, movies, as well as music. Like Buzz!: The Music Quiz, Buzz!: The Big Quiz was released for the PlayStation 2 exclusively in Europe.
