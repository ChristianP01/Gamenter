Titolo: Namco Museum Vol. 1

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Namco Museum Vol. 1 is a 1995 arcade video game compilation developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation. The collection includes seven arcade games developed by the company that were originally released in the 1980s, such as Pac-Man, Galaga and Pole Position. The compilation features a 3D open-world virtual museum that the player can interact with, the games being housed in themed rooms with exhibits, such as promotional flyers, cabinet artwork and instruction cards. Players can also view Namco product catalogs, promotional pamphlets and front cover scans of the company's Japanese press literature.
The game's development was directed by Shinichir≈ç Okamoto, with Galaga creator Shigeru Yokoyama assigned as producer. The Namco Museum name was originally used for a chain of Namco-owned department stores in the early 1980s that sold goods based on Namco game characters. Each of the included arcade games use a JAMMA emulator running the game's original source code, making them near-perfect arcade ports.
Namco Museum Vol. 1 was met with mixed to favorable reviews from critics. Although its loading times and lack of appeal to modern players was criticized, it was praised for its replay value, virtual museum and included exhibits, as well as the selection of included titles. It would go on to sell 1.65 million units in North America alone and spawn five additional volumes, alongside similar collections for other platforms. A digital version of the game was released for the PlayStation Store in 2014 under the PSone Classics brand.
