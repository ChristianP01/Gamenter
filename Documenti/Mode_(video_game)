Titolo: Mode (video game)

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Mode (1996) is the second of two published Full Motion Video (FMV) interactive multimedia CD-ROM based collaborations between writer and director Jeff Green and the Animatics Multimedia Corporation. The success and international acclaim of their first title, Midnight Stranger in 1994, led to a production partnership and publishing arrangement with Corel Corporation, an expanded production budget, and the creation of an associated web site version called "Club Mode". Mode was intended to be the launch vehicle for an expansion of Corel's CD Home Collection into the multimedia entertainment business; however, after a scathing review in PC Gamer magazine, Corel never fully released Mode, the division responsible for the CD Home Collection was shut down, and its software assets were sold to Hoffmann + Associates of Toronto. Mode did receive many favourable reviews at the time, and has since developed an international fan base, see Reception below. Edited playthroughs by one player posted on YouTube between 2012 and 2014 have collectively received over 100,000 views.Experienced from the player's Point Of View (POV), users find themselves at the start of the game crashing an exclusive high-society fashion and art party on the top floor of an unnamed hotel hosted by anarchist artist Vito Brevis. The primary mystery at the heart of the event is Vitoâ€™s true intentions. He appears cynical and anarchistic, but hidden information can be found that implies that he is actually part of a secret cabal that is using this event as some kind of supernatural ritual. The gameplay progresses through emotion-based interactions with other characters that are also attending the party, with the goal of creating in the player a feeling of shared intimacy with those characters.
