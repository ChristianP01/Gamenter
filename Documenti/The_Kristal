Titolo: The Kristal

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: The Kristal is an action game/adventure game first released in 1989 for the Amiga computer.  It was later released for the Atari ST and MS-DOS.  It was developed by the UK-based company Fissionchip Software, and published in Europe by Addictive Games and in the US by Cinemaware.  Unusually for a video game, the game is based on a play, The Kristal of Konos, written in 1976; the authors of the play worked together with the game developers and the play was never shown in theatres or on film before the game's release. A dialog introducing the setting recorded by Patrick Moore, who introduced both the game and play.
The player takes the role of a pirate named Dancis Frake, on a mission to recover the "Kristal" on behalf of the Kring of Meltoca.
The game features a number of different classic game genres merged: fighting, space flight/combat, and (to a limited extent) LucasArts-style point-and-click adventuring.
