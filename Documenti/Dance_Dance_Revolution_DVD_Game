Titolo: Dance Dance Revolution DVD Game

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Dance Dance Revolution DVD Game is a 2006 DVD-based game in the Dance Dance Revolution series (or DDR series) hosted by Roxee, a member of the Australian children's entertainment property, The Funkees. It is unique from other DDR games for a number of reasons. It was the first DDR game not to be developed by the creators of the original series, Konami. The only other non-Konami-developed DDR game is the Disney Channel Edition. To date it remains the only game neither developed nor published by Konami and, perhaps more significantly, it is the only game in the series which lacks input.
