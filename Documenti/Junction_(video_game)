Titolo: Junction (video game)

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Junction (ジャンクション) is a puzzle video game developed  and published by Micronet  in 1990 under license by Konami. Using a variety of sliding puzzles, the player rolls a ball (possibly containing a small armadillo character, as implied by the game's introduction) along tracks set on tiles. Players must align the tracks together and make the ball roll over bridged tracks, set on the border of the puzzle in order to complete each level. Junction has a total of 50 levels which the player can select at random, but a certain number of points have to be reached by level 50, in order for the player to beat the game and see the ending.
Junction is similar in design to Konami's Loco-Motion arcade game from 1982, but with isometric graphics.
The Sega Game Gear version had a reference to Curse, a previous Micronet game, in its opening.
