Titolo: Barney Bear (game series)

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: The Barney Bear series is a collection of educational video games intended for children aged 2-6, programmed by Dave Krohne with artwork by Stephen Beam. Each was published by Free Spirit Software Inc. in a departure from previous adult-oriented erotic games. The Barney Bear games are presented as interactive picture books narrated by a synthesized voice. In each game, the protagonist Barney Bear goes to a new location where players are presented with a simple story and activities. There are five Barney Bear titles: Barney Bear Goes to School, Barney Bear Goes to the Farm, Barney Bear Goes to Space, Barney Bear Meets Santa Claus, and Barney Bears Goes Camping.
The games were well received for their intended audience of young children, particularly as a way to acclimate children to then-novel home computers.
