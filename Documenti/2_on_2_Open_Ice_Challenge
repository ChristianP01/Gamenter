Titolo: 2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: 2 On 2 Open Ice Challenge, also known as NHL Open Ice: 2 on 2 Challenge, or just NHL Open Ice, is an ice hockey arcade game released by Midway Games in 1995. It features comically exaggerated hockey play, causing it to often be described as an ice hockey equivalent to Midway's NBA Jam. It was ported to PlayStation in 1996. The game would be similar to its arcade counterpart with exception to the fact that the Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix after the conclusion of the 1995â€“96 season, thus the Phoenix Coyotes replaced the Jets in the PlayStation port. In addition, much of the team's roster was changed, including its goalie, Tim Cheveldae being replaced by Nikolai Khabibulin, therefore Cheveldae was unable to be a goalie playing for any team in the PlayStation version.
Open Ice was released on PC (Windows) in 1996-1997 featuring the same roster and teams as the PlayStation version. This game is an official licensed product of the NHLPA (National Hockey League Players Association).
