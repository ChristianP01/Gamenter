Titolo: Black Widow (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: Black Widow is a multidirectional shooter developed by Atari, Inc. and  released in arcades in 1982. The game uses color vector graphics. The player controls a black widow spider via two joysticks, one to move and one to fire, defending the web from insects.
Black Widow was offered as a conversion kit for Gravitar, which was not a successful game. The kit used the original Gravitar PCB with a few small modifications and a new set of ROM chips. Many factory-built Black Widows were produced using unsold Gravitar cabinets with Black Widow sideart applied over the Gravitar sideart.
