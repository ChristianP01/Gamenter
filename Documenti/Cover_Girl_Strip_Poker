Titolo: Cover Girl Strip Poker

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Cover Girl Strip Poker, alternately titled Cover Girl Poker, is a 1991 erotic video game based upon five-card strip poker and originally developed and self-published by Emotional Pictures; it was released for the Amiga, DOS, Commodore 64, CDTV, and CD32. Cover Girl Strip Poker is the original Danish title; it was retitled Cover Girl Poker outside of Denmark in the rest of Europe, and the title was subsequently reverted to Cover Girl Strip Poker for the European CDTV and CD-ROM DOS releases. Emotional Pictures was a subsidiary of Danish company InterActive Vision A/S.
Cover Girl Strip Poker received negative to mixed reviews from critics; many reviews criticized Strip Poker's 'poor' digitized graphics, 'bad' AI, and several reviews criticized the game's sexual content, calling it 'unappealing' or 'sad'. While other versions of the game received more mixed reviews, reviews of the Commodore 64 version were universally negative. Some reviews criticized Strip Poker as sexist, with one magazine calling it "an affront to the female species". In addendum to this, Strip Poker has a legal disclaimer stating that the game is "Not manufactured, distributed or endorsed by any of the models appearing in the product"; a model featured in the game later stated that she was not informed what the video footage/photoshoot was for, and several models did not receive pay for their work.
