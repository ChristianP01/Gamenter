Titolo: Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy, released as Ace Combat 3D: Cross Rumble (エースコンバット 3D クロスランブル, Ēsu Konbatto Surī Dī Kurosu Ranburu) in Japan, is a 2011 combat flight simulation video game for the Nintendo 3DS, developed by Access Games and published by Namco Bandai Games and a remake of Ace Combat 2. It is a combat flight simulation game but it is presented in a more arcade-like format in contrast to other flight-sim games. Despite the game's international title outside Japan, it has little relation to Ace Combat: Assault Horizon. The original Japanese version features compatibility with the Circle Pad Pro accessory.
The enhanced version, Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy + (エースコンバット 3D クロスランブル ＋) was released in Japan on January 29, 2015, with added support for Amiibo figures, as well as updated control handling for the New Nintendo 3DS. It was also released in North America and Europe later in February.
