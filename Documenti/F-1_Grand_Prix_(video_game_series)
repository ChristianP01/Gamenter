Descrizione: F-1 Grand Prix (エフワングランプリ) is a series of Formula One video games developed and published by Video System, primarily known for developing the Aero Fighters series. Prior to obtaining the FOCA license, the company previously released an arcade game in 1989 (based on the 1988 season) called Tail to Nose: Great Championship (known in Japan as Super Formula: Chijō Saisoku no Battle). Video System began releasing officially licensed titles in 1991 as an arcade game and for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, initially featuring content from the 1991 season; the company later followed up by releasing games based on the 1992 and 1993 seasons, although the 1993 season game had no arcade release. The arcade and SNES games are played with a top-down view centered on the players chosen vehicles. These titles feature the song "Truth" by T-Square, featured branding from Fuji Television's Formula One coverage, and were only released in Japan. Video System also developed SD F-1 Grand Prix, a Super Mario Kart style game featuring animal caricatures of selected 1994 drivers.
In 1998, Video System regained the Formula One license after a three-year break. The later games, named under the F1 World Grand Prix banner, featured a 3D polygon-based simulation-style racing. Some of these titles were also published by Eidos Interactive. Video System is also credited as a publisher for F1 Racing Championship, based on the 1999 season and developed by Ubi Soft.
