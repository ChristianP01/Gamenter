Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Code Age Brawls (コード・エイジ　ブロウルズ) is a video game developed by Square Enix for mobile phones and is part of the Code Age franchise. It follows a woman on another world who has been partially transformed into a powerful creature called a Warhead, who must continually battle other creatures known as Coded in order to take over their bodies and stay alive. The world is set to be destroyed, and the protagonist must find a way to survive the apocalypse.
The game's battles are rock-paper-scissors-like contests using colored badges across five rounds. Players can also compete online for territory using their real world locations. The world of the game was developed over three years and was released along with another video game and a manga comic that are all connected.
The game was only released in Japan, like its sister game in the franchise, Code Age Commanders. Reviewers at the time it was demoed highly praised the demo's character models and graphical detail.
