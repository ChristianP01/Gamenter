Titolo: Nester's Funky Bowling

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Nester's Funky Bowling is a bowling video game developed by Saffire and published by Nintendo for the Virtual Boy console. It was only released in North America on February 26, 1996, and was the second-to-last game released for the system before it was discontinued. Players control Nester, a character from the Nintendo Power comics, or his twin sister Hester, as they compete to see who is the superior bowler. It features standard bowling mechanics and rules, and has three modes of play - Bowling, Challenge, and Practice, all three supporting one or two players.
It has received generally mixed reception; while some found it to be a poor or average game, such as staff for IGN and GamePro, Nintendo Power and Allgame were more forgiving, toting it as a quality game compared to other titles in the Virtual Boy library. Its graphics received some recognition, though it was faulted for its lack of a save function and lack of game modes.
