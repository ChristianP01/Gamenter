Titolo: Gungrave: Overdose

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Gungrave: Overdose (ガングレイヴO.D., Gangureivu Ōbādōsu) is a PlayStation 2 third-person shooter video game developed by animation studio Ikusabune and published by Red Entertainment in Japan and by Mastiff in North America, and a direct sequel to Gungrave. The game was released on March 4, 2004 in Japan, September 15, 2004 in North America and October 7, 2005 in the PAL regions. Gungrave: Overdose picks up where its predecessor left off, and follows its main character through a variety of stages on a path of revenge. It is the only known title fully developed by animation studio Ikusabune, as the previous title was developed by Red Entertainment. (Ikusabune provided animation and cinematics in the first game.)
Two years after the original, Gungrave, and just approaching of that game's anime adaptation, Gungrave: Overdose was released. Preserving Yasuhiro Nightow's flair and artistic style, this outing adds new playable characters to the series and a new story, in which Grave resumes his tale as an unlikely anti-hero tracking down the sadistic son of a Mafia boss who has struck a deal with a symbiotic seed bent on taking over the Earth.
