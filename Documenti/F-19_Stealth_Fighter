Titolo: F-19 Stealth Fighter

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: F-19 Stealth Fighter is a combat flight simulator developed and released in 1988 (PC DOS) and 1990 (Amiga and Atari ST) by MicroProse, featuring a fictional United States military aircraft. It is the 16-bit remake of the 8-bit game Project Stealth Fighter, which was released for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1987. It was also ported to the NEC PC-9801 in Japan only, and the DOS version was re-released on Steam distribution platform in 2015.
F-19 Stealth Fighter was developed before the public unveiling in 1988 of the F-117 Nighthawk attack aircraft – which the video game sought to represent – and MicroProse's rendering of the jet bears little resemblance to the actual F-117, including its designation. Instead, game designers relied on a 1986 F-19 model kit released by Testors.
Critically acclaimed, the game was followed in 1991 by Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0, which offered the player a choice between the old, fictitious aircraft design and a new, realistic one.
