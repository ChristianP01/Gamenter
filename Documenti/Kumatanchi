Titolo: Kumatanchi

Anno: 2008

Descrizione: Kumatanchi (Japanese: くまたんち, "Kuma-tan Zoo") is a life simulation video game co-developed for the Nintendo DS by Vanillaware and doujin studio Ashinaga Oji-san. It was published on September 25, 2008 by Dimple Entertainment. The premise and gameplay revolves around the player taking care of an anthropomorphic girl based on the mascot character Habanero-tan, seeing her interactions with other anthropomorphic characters over two weeks in real-time. Due to its gameplay and subject matter, it was only released in Japan.
Vanillaware artist Shigetake acted as both director and character designer, with the game being an attempt by Vanillaware to produce two projects at the same time. Production was stressful due to staff shortages, putting Shigetake off the idea of directing any more games. The music, composed by Kimihiro Abe and Mitsuhiro Kaneda of Basiscape, was meant to break away from the company's traditional sound. Kumatanchi met with low sales and mixed reviews from Japanese and Western journalists.
