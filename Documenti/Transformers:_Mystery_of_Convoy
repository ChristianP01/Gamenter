Titolo: Transformers: Mystery of Convoy

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Transformers: Mystery of Convoy is a 1986 video game developed by ISCO and published by Takara in Japan for the Famicom. It is based on the popular toyline Transformers. The game was made available on the Wii's Virtual Console service on June 10, 2008.The game stars Autobot protagonist Ultra Magnus. The titular Mystery is the identity of Optimus Prime's (referred to in the title as "Convoy") killer, as the 1986 film did not see a Japanese release for another four years. Thus, Optimus Prime's death was not adequately explained to the Japanese audience; this game was intended to capitalize on that gap.
