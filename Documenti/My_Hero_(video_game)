Titolo: My Hero (video game)

Anno: 1985

Descrizione: My Hero, known as Seishun Scandal (青春スキャンダル, Seishun Sukyandaru, lit. 'Youth Scandal') in Japan, is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game released by Sega for arcades in 1985 and for the Master System on January 1, 1986.
The gameplay format is similar to Irem's Kung-Fu Master (1984), released a year earlier. In contrast to earlier martial arts games, My Hero departs from a more traditional martial arts setting, instead taking place in a contemporary urban city environment with street gangs, like later beat 'em ups such as Renegade (1986) and Double Dragon (1987).
