Descrizione: Bad Piggies is a puzzle video game developed by Rovio Entertainment, and was the company's first spin-off of Angry Birds. The game launched on Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac on September 27, 2012. It was released for BlackBerry 10 in October 2013 and for Windows Phone in April 2014. Unlike the Angry Birds games, the player assists the minion pigs in building contraptions that travel on land and in air to collect pieces of a map to ultimately capture and take away the Angry Birdsâ€™ eggs. As of October 2012, Bad Piggies was the fastest-selling game on the Apple App Store, and the quickest one to reach the top of the app list in just three hours.In June 2014, Rovio made Bad Piggies free-to-play, since it previously had a purchase price. Advertisements were also implemented.
Between April 2019 and July 2019, the game was removed from the Google Play Store and App Store. But in early 2020, the game was added back worldwide.
