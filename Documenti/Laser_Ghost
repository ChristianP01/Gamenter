Descrizione: Laser Ghost is a horror-themed light gun shooter arcade video game released by Sega in 1990. The game is patterned after the films Ghostbusters and Poltergeist III, casting the player as a ghost hunter. There are three mounted guns set up on the cabinet, representing the three members of a ghost hunting team. The game puts the players in the role of Bill, Max and Carol, who must rescue a little girl kidnapped by a blue gargoyle, as well as protect the city from the ghost menaces. A Master System game with the same title was released in 1991 exclusively for Europe, but was not based on the arcade original.
