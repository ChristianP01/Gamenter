Descrizione: Lunar: Sanposuru Gakuen (Lunar さんぽする学園, lit. "Lunar: Walking School") is a role-playing video game in the Lunar series released for the Sega Game Gear in Japan in 1996. Since then, no international versions or translations have officially been released, though an unofficial English translation was released in 2009. It was developed and produced by the Japanese software company Game Arts and Studio Alex, their in-house development team responsible for other Lunar titles.
