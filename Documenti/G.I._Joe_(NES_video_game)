Descrizione: G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero is a 1991 run and gun game published by Taxan for the Nintendo Entertainment System based on the toyline of the same name. The game was produced by Ken Lobb and developed by the same Japanese team that later formed KID. A sequel developed by the same team, titled G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor, was released the following year, but was published by Capcom after Taxan went out of business.
G.I. Joe on the NES garnered positive reception from reviewers since its initial release; praise was given to the colorful graphics, ability to choose between characters and form a team, soundtrack, controls, gameplay and music but the occasional flickering issues was criticized. Retrospective commentary has been positive.
