Titolo: Arcade Classics (CD-i game)

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Arcade Classics is a video game compilation for the Philips CD-i containing ports of three Namco arcade games. The compilation was released in Europe but not in North America.
It contains the games Galaxian (1979), Ms. Pac-Man (1981), and Galaga (1981). Galaxian resembles the Famicom port instead of it representing the original arcade game. Galaga is cropped into a "window" while the status (lives, score, etc.) is moved into the outer frame. Ms. Pac-Man resembles Tengen's ports of the game and even includes the extras from their ports (multiple sets of mazes, simultaneous multiplayer, etc.).
