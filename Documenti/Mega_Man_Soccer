Titolo: Mega Man Soccer

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Mega Man Soccer is a soccer video game for the Super NES. The game is based on the original Mega Man series of action-platform games. Mega Man Soccer was released in Japan on February 17, 1994, and in North America in March of that same year.
Mega Man Soccer is a traditional soccer game with exhibition matches, tournaments, and leagues that can be played both single-player and multiplayer depending on the mode. The game features characters and Robot Masters from previous entries in the original Mega Man series. Each character has a unique special shot that will temporarily disable anyone that comes in contact with the ball. This aspect of Mega Man Soccer was met with critical praise, but overall reception has been average, particularly due to its perceived poor play control.
