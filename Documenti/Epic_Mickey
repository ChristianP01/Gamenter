Epic Mickey was part of an effort by Disney to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by placing less emphasis on his pleasant, cheerful side and reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides of his personality, focusing on the idea of depicting him as an epic hero. It was directed by Warren Spector, who collaborated with Walt Disney Animation Studios in conjunction with the project. The game was announced in October 2009, and released in November 2010. The game received mixed reviews from critics. Successors to the franchise include Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two and Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion.
