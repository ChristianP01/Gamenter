Titolo: Bust a Groove

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Bust a Groove is a hybrid music/fighting video game for the Sony PlayStation released in 1998. The game was developed by Metro and published by Enix in Japan, brought to the U.S. by 989 Studios and to Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe.
One of the first rhythm games to follow in the wake of PaRappa the Rapper's unexpected popularity, the game combined PaRappa the Rapper-inspired rhythm-based gameplay with elements of fighting games, including special moves designed to damage the opponent and head-to-head competitive play. The Japanese version is titled Bust a Move: Dance & Rhythm Action (バスト ア ムーブ Dance & Rhythm Action, Basuto a Mūbu Dance & Rhythm Action), but in all other regions it was released as Bust-A-Groove, to avoid a trademark conflict with the Japanese puzzle game Puzzle Bobble, which was released in North America and Europe as Bust-A-Move.
The sequel, Bust a Groove 2, unlike its predecessor, wasn't planned to be released in Europe, and Dance Summit 2001, the third game in the series, was released only in Japan on the PlayStation 2.
