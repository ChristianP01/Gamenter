Titolo: Mark Leung

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Mark Leung: Revenge of the Bitch is a parody role-playing game developed by Uglysoft. The game is released in January 2011, and is the first installment of an episodic series.
Mark Leung was written, produced and directed by College Saga creator Mark Leung. As a spiritual successor to the film, cutscenes in the game are presented with live action video clips with actors cosplaying the characters. The game frequently makes references to the popular culture such as the Double Rainbow, flaming trolls and the Kanye West interruption at the VMAs. Many characters and monsters are bizarre hybrids of public figures and well-known characters, such as Jhompson, a summonable character inspired by Jack Thompson and Illidan Stormrage of World of Warcraft, and McFunny, a boss character inspired by Joker and Ronald McDonald. Recent events such as the subprime mortgage crisis also inspired a bank-themed dungeon and a cleric named Brother Lehman.
