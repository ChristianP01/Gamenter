Descrizione: Leaf Trombone: World Stage was a massively multiplayer online music game for the Apple iOS, developed by Smule and released on April 15, 2009 through the App Store. The game simulates a trombone based on a traditional Chinese leaf instrument, similar to a slide whistle. In the game, players can play the Leaf trombone along to a variety of tunes, as well as compose and publish songs of their own for anyone to play. Along with a "Free Play" mode, the "World Stage" feature provides a venue where players can perform their songs live for a global audience and receive ratings on a 1 to 10 scale from three separate judges. Following each performance, a player's rating is added to their previous ratings creating a comprehensive score reflecting the player's skill within the online community.  The creators at Smule claim that Leaf Trombone: World Stage is "an instrument, a game, and a huge global social experience."
