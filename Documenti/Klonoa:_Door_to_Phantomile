Titolo: Klonoa: Door to Phantomile

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a platform game developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation in 1997 and the first game in the Klonoa series. The story follows Klonoa and his friend Huepow in their efforts to save the dream world of Phantomile from an evil spirit intent on turning it into a world of nightmares. The player controls Klonoa through a 2.5D perspective; the stages are rendered in three dimensions but the player moves along a 2D path. Klonoa can grab enemies and throw them as projectiles, or use them as a jump boost to navigate through the stages.
The game was directed by Hideo Yoshizawa, who conceptualized the setting as a dream world that could appeal to children and adults. The Klonoa character was designed early on and the environments and other characters were designed around him. Door to Phantomile received positive reviews, being praised for its clever platforming, impressive graphics, and cutscenes. Some critics thought it lacked in certain gameplay innovations and was excessive in its Japanese cuteness. In retrospect, it is considered one of the best 2.5D platformers and greatest PlayStation games of all time. The game spawned a direct sequel, Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil, for PlayStation 2 in 2001, as well as multiple spin-off titles. A remake of the game was released for the Wii in 2008, and a HD remaster of the remake and Klonoa 2, titled Klonoa: Phantasy Reverie Series, is planned for release on multiple platforms in 2022.
