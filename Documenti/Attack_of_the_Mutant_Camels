Titolo: Attack of the Mutant Camels

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Attack of the Mutant Camels is a surrealist computer game written by Jeff Minter and released for the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit family in 1983 by Minter's Llamasoft. The horizontally scrolling shooter is similar to the Atari 2600 game The Empire Strikes Back (1982), with AT-AT walkers replaced by giant camels. Confusingly, a very different game from Jeff Minter's Gridrunner series was also released in the US under the name Attack of the Mutant Camels.
Llamasoft released a sequel, Revenge of the Mutant Camels, in 1984.
