Titolo: Daytona USA

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: Daytona USA is an arcade racing video game developed by Sega AM2 in 1993 and released by Sega in 1994. Players race stock cars on one of three courses. The first game released on the Sega Model 2 three-dimensional arcade system board, a prototype debuted at Tokyo's Amusement Machine Show in August 1993 and was location tested in Japan the same month, before the complete game released in March 1994. Daytona USA is one of the highest-grossing arcade games of all time.
Inspired by the popularity of the NASCAR motor racing series in the U.S., Daytona USA was developed by AM2 after a meeting of the heads of Sega's regional offices for a game to debut the Model 2 hardware. The concept was suggested by Tom Petit, president of Sega's American arcade division, with input from AM2 director Toshihiro Nagoshi, who became the game's director and producer. Sega aimed to outperform Namco's Ridge Racer (1993). The developers researched motorsports extensively; they used satellite imagery and photography to map the Daytona International Speedway, and their experience developing Virtua Racing (1992) helped with lighting and camera control. Visual effects include texture filtering and texture mapping, a 60-frames-per second frame rate, and four different camera perspectives.
Daytona USA was a critical and commercial success, praised for its graphics, soundtrack and realism. It was ported to the Sega Saturn home console in 1995, and followed by sequels and enhancements for consoles and arcades. It was influential on the racing genre, and has been frequently named one of the best video games of all time.
