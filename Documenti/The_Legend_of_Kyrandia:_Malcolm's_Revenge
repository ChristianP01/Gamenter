Titolo: The Legend of Kyrandia: Malcolm's Revenge

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: The Legend of Kyrandia: Book Three - Malcolm's Revenge is a 2D point-and-click adventure game, developed by Westwood Studios and published by Virgin Interactive in 1994. It is the sequel to The Legend of Kyrandia: Hand of Fate, and the third and final game in the Fables & Fiends series. The game sees players take on the role of the antagonist from the first game in the series, who begins plotting his revenge against those who thwarted him, only to find himself eventually seeking to prove his innocence of a murder he did not commit.
The game functioned with the same point-and-click interface used in previous titles, but with the ability for the lead character to switch between different personalities to solve puzzles and a point-based system. Westwood also developed the game with a special video encoding method that formatted into .VQA (Vector Quantized Animation) file format. Malcolm's Revenge received mixed reviews on its release, while achieving less sales due to Westwood's decision to focus on Command & Conquer by the mid 1990s. GOG.com released an emulated version for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X in 2013.
