Titolo: Dragon Ball Z: Hyper Dimension

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Dragon Ball Z: Hyper Dimension is a 1996 fighting video game developed by Tose and published by Bandai for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Based upon Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball franchise, it is the last fighting game in the series to be released for SNES. Following from the Freezer arc to the conclusion of the Majin Buu saga, its gameplay is similar to the earlier Super Butōden entries, consisting of one-on-one fights using a main six-button configuration, featuring special moves as well as multiple game modes.
Dragon Ball Z: Hyper Dimension was created over the course of 15 months by most of the same team who worked on the previous three Super Butōden entries for Super Nintendo, with producers Takeo Isogai and Toshihiro Suzuki returning to helm its production, alongside staff from both Toei Animation and V Jump magazine assisting with its development. Hyper Dimension garnered positive reception from critics, but the European version received criticism for its absence of a story mode. The game has never been officially released outside Japan and Europe, although a fan translation exist.
