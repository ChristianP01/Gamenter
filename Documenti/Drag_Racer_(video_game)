Descrizione: The Drag Racer franchise is a series of games that were developed by Waterloo, Ontario-based game designer Adam Telfer, who started designing this Flash game at the age of 14. The game, first released in 2003 was later ported to iOS devices (iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad) as a partnership with XMG Studio.  The core game-play in Drag Racer is quite simple. Players purchase cars that they customize, upgrade, tune and then race opponents in an effort to win credits that allows them to upgrade existing cars or buy new ones.
