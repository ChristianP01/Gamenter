It was released in North America on February 25, 2002 and in Europe on March 15, 2002.The Huge Adventure is the seventh installment in the Crash Bandicoot video game series, the first Crash Bandicoot game not to be released on a PlayStation console, and the first Crash Bandicoot game to be released on a handheld console. The game acts as an alternate sequel to the first four mainline games, and its story centers on a plot to shrink the Earth by the main antagonist, Doctor Neo Cortex, through the use of a gigantic weapon named the "Planetary Minimizer". The protagonist of the story, Crash Bandicoot, must gather Crystals in order to power a device that will return the Earth to its proper size, defeating Doctor Cortex and his minions along the way.
The game stemmed from an agreement between Universal Interactive Studios and Konami that enabled them to produce and publish (respectively) a Crash Bandicoot game for next-generation handheld game systems, ending the franchise's exclusivity to Sony-produced consoles. Critical reactions to Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure were generally positive; the game was praised for its graphics and overall design, but critics noted the game's lack of innovation. A sequel, Crash Bandicoot 2: N-Tranced, was released in 2003.
