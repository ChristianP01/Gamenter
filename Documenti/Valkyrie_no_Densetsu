Titolo: Valkyrie no Densetsu

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Valkyrie no Densetsu is a 1989 action-adventure role-playing arcade game developed and published in Japan by Namco. It is a follow-up to the Family Computer game Valkyrie no B≈çken (1986). Players control the warrior maiden Valkyrie and her lizard-like companion Kurino Xandra as they set out to drop a mythical item called the Golden Seed into the Northern Fountain to replenish the dying crop fields of Xandra Land. Gameplay involves defeating enemies and collecting gold to purchase magical spells and weapons in shops.
Valkyrie no Densetsu was the creation of Namco artist Hiroshi Fujii and a designer only known by the pseudonym of "Koakuman". The game's world, the fictional kingdom of Marvel Land, was greatly inspired by Viking tales from northern Europe and the middle ages, with a heavy emphasis on having a sort-of "magical" feel of it. It was originally meant to be a four-player action game in the vein of titles like Gauntlet with a cabinet-linking system similar to Final Lap, which was scrapped later on. Characters were made to have personality and depth, a design choice inspired by The Wizard of Oz.
Valkyrie no Densetsu was released in arcades to critical acclaim for its gameplay, characters, and world. Namco ported the game to the PC Engine in 1990, a conversion that was met with a more mixed response for its difficulty, downgraded graphics, and altered gameplay. The game was mostly unknown outside Japan until the release of Namco Museum Vol. 5 in 1997, which renamed the game to The Legend of Valkyrie and was fully translated into English. Several additional ports were made, including those for Windows, Japanese mobile phones, and the Wii Virtual Console.
