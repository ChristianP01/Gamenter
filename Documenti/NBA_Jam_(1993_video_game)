Descrizione: NBA Jam is a basketball video game developed and published by Midway for arcades in 1993. It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The project leader for this game was Mark Turmell.
NBA Jam was the third basketball video game released by Midway, after TV Basketball (1974) and Arch Rivals (1989). Midway had previously also released such sports video games as the American football titles High Impact (1990) and Super High Impact (1991). The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, which was also a 2-on-2 basketball game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.
The release of NBA Jam gave popularized a subgenre of basketball games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge, later NHL Hitz) and baseball (MLB Slugfest).
