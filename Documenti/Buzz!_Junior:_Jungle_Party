Many of these mini-games require little knowledge or skill, so that they are more suited to younger children than the normal Buzz! quiz games, although they can also be enjoyed by older children or even adults. Cohort Studios developed a PlayStation 3 version where the player can use a Dualshock wireless controller for the 1st time, yet is limited to only 5 playable mini-games.The game received mixed reviews, and was a British Academy Children's Awards winner.A PSP version of the game was released in November 2010.
