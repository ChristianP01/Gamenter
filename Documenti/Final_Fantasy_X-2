Titolo: Final Fantasy X-2

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Final Fantasy X-2 is a 2003 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the PlayStation 2. It is a direct sequel to 2001's Final Fantasy X, the first game in the Final Fantasy series to receive such a follow-up. The story follows Yuna as she searches for Tidus, the main character of the previous game, while trying to prevent political conflicts in Spira from escalating to war.
In addition to being the first direct Final Fantasy sequel, Final Fantasy X-2 was the first game in the series to feature just three player characters and an all-female main cast. The battle system incorporates Final Fantasy character classes—one of the series' signature gameplay concepts—and is one of the few entries to have multiple endings. The soundtrack was created by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi in lieu of long-time Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu.
The game was positively received by critics and was commercially successful, selling over 5.4 million copies on PlayStation 2 and winning a number of awards. It was the last Final Fantasy game to be released by Square before it merged with Enix in April 2003. The game was re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, alongside Final Fantasy X, as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster. Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster was later released for the PlayStation 4 in 2015, Microsoft Windows in 2016, and the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch in 2019.
