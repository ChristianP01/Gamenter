Anno: 1985

Descrizione: Kingâ€™s Valley is a platform game released by Konami for MSX in 1985. The game is considered a spiritual successor to Konami's earlier arcade game Tutankham (1982), employing similar concepts such as treasure hunting in Egyptian tombs and an identical end-level music tune. It also has similarities to Lode Runner (1983).
The game was initially released on ROM cartridge with 15 levels. It was also planned to be released on floppy disk with 60 levels but that version was shelved. The floppy disk version would ultimately be released a few years later in 1988 as part of Konami Game Collection Vol. 1 on MSX.
