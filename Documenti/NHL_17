Descrizione: NHL 17 is an ice hockey simulation video game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports. It is the 26th installment in the NHL game series and was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in September 2016.
The development team focused solely on eighth generation console versions for NHL 17, citing an increased player base on those consoles over seventh generation ones. They utilized Electronic Arts' Ignite engine and built the game off of that, attempting to generally improve on the series' previous installment. They introduced gameplay improvements in terms of artificial intelligence and physics as well as new mode such as the World Cup of Hockey tournament mode and a revamped version of "Be a GM", a simulation mode where the player acts as a team's general manager, titled "Franchise Mode", which now features team owners and team relocation. A newer Creation Zone was also added, featuring an expansive team builder as well as an arena creator. Modes from its predecessor saw a return as well, including the trading card-based team building mode Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT), the online co-operative play mode known as EA Sports Hockey League, and Be a Pro, a career mode. Similar to the past two NHL titles, NHL 17 features presentation in the style of the NHL on NBC.
