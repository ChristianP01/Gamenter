Titolo: Batman: The Caped Crusader

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Batman: The Caped Crusader is an action-adventure game developed by Special FX Software (Jonathan Smith, Zach Townsend, Charles Davies, and Keith Tinman) and published by Ocean Software in 1988. It was licensed by Data East and Erbe Software for release in North America and Spain. It was the second of three unrelated Batman games released by Ocean, after Batman in 1986 and preceding Batman: The Movie in 1989. The Apple II version was developed by California-based Quicksilver Software; it requires a 128k IIe or IIc to run. As with many other Ocean releases, the C64 port came in separate cassette and disk releases; the North American NTSC version was based on the latter. The disk version contained slightly remixed music and differences in enemy spawns.
