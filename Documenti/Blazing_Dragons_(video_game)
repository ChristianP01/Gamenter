Descrizione: Blazing Dragons is a point-and-click adventure game developed by the Illusions Gaming Company and published by Crystal Dynamics. It is based on the television series of the same name and was released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in late 1996. 
The game is based on the legend of King Arthur with the player controlling Flicker, a dragon who lives in Camelhot castle. He is in love with Princess Flame, but is not eligible to ask for her hand in marriage because he is not a knight and must pass a trial hosted by the King to become one. The writing and humor in the game is heavily influenced by Monty Python, with Terry Jones serving as one of the game's many voice actors.
