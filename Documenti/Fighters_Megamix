Titolo: Fighters Megamix

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Fighters Megamix (ファイターズ メガミックス, Faitāzu Megamikkusu) is a 1996 fighting video game developed by Sega AM2 for the Sega Saturn. It is a video game crossover of various 3D arcade blockbusters by Sega, from the complete cast of Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers to Janet from Virtua Cop 2 and the Hornet car from Daytona USA. It allows gamers to play as the bosses of both Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers without codes.
Intended as an introduction to Virtua Fighter 3 (which was announced but never released for the Saturn), Fighters Megamix utilized the concept originally used by The King of Fighters, whereby characters and styles from different games were mixed together. The open ended rings from Virtua Fighter are present (but with no ring-out), and also the closed cages from Fighting Vipers. Virtua Fighter characters have new moves taken from Virtua Fighter 3, including the dodge move, which allows characters to sidestep, avoiding a dangerous blow and opening at the same time room for a counter. Upon release it was hailed as one of the Saturn's best games, with critics deeming its crossover mechanics a complete success, and met with strong sales.
Unlike most of AM2's games of the era, Fighters Megamix did not have an arcade release. In 1998 an adaptation for the Game.com was released by Tiger Electronics.
