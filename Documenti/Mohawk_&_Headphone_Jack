Titolo: Mohawk & Headphone Jack

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Mohawk & Headphone Jack (alternately written as Mo Hawk & Headphone Jack) is a 1996 2D rotational game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
The game was developed by American studio Solid Software, published by THQ and distributed by Electro Source. The programming credit for the game is held by industry veteran D. Scott Williamson. The game spins around and around wildly in a circle, changing the rotation of the map also, and making it difficult to continue in the right direction. Rock music plays in the background as one or two players attempt to negotiate a treacherous series of platforms throughout the game's 14 levels. The game's likeness was based on Sonic the Hedgehog.
