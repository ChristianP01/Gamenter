Titolo: Tell Me Why (video game)

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Tell Me Why is an episodic narrative adventure game developed by Dontnod Entertainment and published by Xbox Game Studios. Tell Me Why consists of three episodes released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One. It follows Tyler and Alyson Ronan, a pair of twins with the supernatural ability to communicate with each other through telepathy, who reunite after ten years in their hometown in rural Alaska to investigate the truth behind the death of their mother, Mary-Ann Ronan. A recurring theme of the story is the fallacy of memory, as the narrative explores the twins' childhood trauma and how they may each remember pivotal moments differently.
Announced in November 14, 2019, Tell Me Why attracted media attention during its developmental cycle for being the first AAA video game to feature a transgender character as one of its main characters. The team consulted relevant experts such as GLAAD, a non-governmental organization (NGO) founded to monitor media coverage of LGBT people, to ensure that its portrayal of LGBT characters would be regarded as authentic and respectful. Dontnod also enlisted a trans man as the voice actor for Tyler Ronan, who had transitioned during his time away from his sister.
Tell Me Why received generally favorable reviews, with critics praising the complex characters, voice acting, narrative design and setting, as well as its competent handling of culturally sensitive subjects such as transgender topics. Common criticisms included inconsistent storytelling and lack of engaging gameplay.
