Titolo: Aggressors of Dark Kombat

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Aggressors of Dark Kombat, known in Japan as Thrilling Intense March (痛快GANGAN行進曲, Tsūkai GANGAN Kōshinkyoku) or simply GanGan, is a 1994 one-on-one fighting arcade game developed by Alpha Denshi Corp. (ADK) and published by SNK. It was also released on SNK's Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD home consoles, and in later decades appeared on retro compilations and digital storefronts. The English game title uses the same initials as the developer and the title is parodying the Mortal Kombat name. The game's defining feature was that, while it uses a generally 2D format, characters can move towards or away from the screen (somewhat similar to the "Oversway" system from the later SNK title Fatal Fury 3: Road to the Final Victory). While some reviews praised this mechanic, critics generally remarked that it offers no meaningful innovation and that the game is generic and lacking in depth. Though a modest success, Aggressors of Dark Kombat failed to match the popularity of the leading SNK fighters.
