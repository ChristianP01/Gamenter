Descrizione: The Familiar of Zero (Japanese: ゼロの使い魔, Hepburn: Zero no Tsukaima) is a Japanese fantasy light novel series written by Noboru Yamaguchi, with illustrations by Eiji Usatsuka. Media Factory published 20 volumes between June 2004 and February 2011. The series was left unfinished due to the author's death in 2013, but was later concluded in two volumes released in February 2016 and February 2017 with a different author, making use of notes left behind by Yamaguchi. The story features several characters from the second year class of a magic academy in a fictional magical world with the main characters being the inept mage Louise and her familiar from Earth, Saito Hiraga.
Between 2006 and 2012, the series was adapted by J.C.Staff into four anime television series and an additional original video animation episode. The first anime series was licensed by Geneon Entertainment in English, but the license expired in 2011. Sentai Filmworks has since re-licensed and re-released the first series and released the other three series in North America. A manga adaptation illustrated by Nana Mochizuki was serialized in Media Factory's manga magazine Monthly Comic Alive between June 2006 and October 2009. The manga was released by Seven Seas Entertainment in North America. Three additional spin-off manga were also created (one of them also localized by Seven Seas Entertainment), as were three visual novels.
