Descrizione: Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition (Japanese: ハイパーストリートファイターII -The Anniversary Edition-) is a fighting game by Capcom that was originally released for the arcade and PlayStation 2 in 2003 in Japan and in 2004 in North America and Asia. Released to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Street Fighter series, Hyper Street Fighter II is a modified port of Super Street Fighter II Turbo in which players can control any versions of the main characters from the five Street Fighter II games previously released for the arcades. Although originally released as a home console game, an arcade port was released shortly afterwards in limited quantities, turning it into the sixth arcade iteration. This game is also the last to use the CP System II.
The PlayStation 2 version was released by itself in Japan and Europe. In North America, it was released in a two-in-one disc titled Street Fighter Anniversary Collection, which also features Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. The Anniversary Collection version was later ported to the Xbox in all regions.
