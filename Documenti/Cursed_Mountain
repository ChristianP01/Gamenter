Titolo: Cursed Mountain

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Cursed Mountain is a 2009 video game co-developed for the Wii by Sproing Interactive and Deep Silver Vienna, and published by Deep Silver. A Europe-exclusive port for Microsoft Windows was developed and released by Deep Silver in 2010. The story follows mountaineer Eric Simmons's trek up Chomolonzo to rescue his brother Frank, who unleashed hostile ghosts and monsters onto the surrounding lands. The gameplay, combining elements of survival horror and action-adventure, follows Eric as he ascends Chomolonzo, collecting items and fighting hostile ghosts.
Including pre-production, development lasted over two years and was shared between multiple external studios; the team included industry veteran Bob Bates as script writer, and former Rockstar Vienna staff. The team wanted to create a game experience unlike others on the market, focusing on open environments and real-world folklore. Pre-production focused on researching Tibetan Buddhist folklore and survival stories from the Himalayas. While motion control-based mechanics were always present, action-based elements were added based on tester feedback.
Announced in 2008, Cursed Mountain saw little marketing support from Deep Silver leading up to release. The game saw a mixed reception. Praise was given to its narrative and atmosphere, but many criticised its use of motion controls. It was the only game created by Deep Silver Vienna before closing down in February 2010.
