Descrizione: Lego Batman: The Videogame is a 2008 action-adventure Lego Batman video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, released for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Nintendo DS, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X. The game is based on the characters appearing in the DC Universe by DC Comics and the Lego Batman toy line, who also handled marketing and financial aspects of the game.
The game is similar to earlier Lego games developed by Traveller's Tales, such as Lego Star Wars series and Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, in that it is both a game based on a licensed property, and has environments, objects, and creatures made out of Lego. However, Lego Batman is the first to have an original story. The Mac OS X version of the game was released in April 2009 by Feral Interactive. The game received positive reviews, and spawned two sequels: Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes and Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, as well as a villains-only spin-off, Lego DC Super-Villains.
