Titolo: The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle, known in Japan as Roger Rabbit (ロジャーラビット) for the Family Computer Disk System, is a 1989 puzzle video game developed by Kemco for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It was also released for the Game Boy in Japan as Mickey Mouse (ミッキーマウス) and in North America as the same name as the North American NES release. It is the first game in Kemco's Crazy Castle series and the only one that was released for a home console; the four subsequent games in the series were released on handheld devices. (This only includes games with the Crazy Castle title; a game in the Japanese Mickey Mouse series was reworked into Kid Klown in Night Mayor World, which saw an NES release and a sequel on Super NES but was not otherwise connected with the North American Crazy Castle games.)
Three different versions starred three different cartoon characters: Bugs Bunny, and Disney's Roger Rabbit and Mickey Mouse, and were first released in 1989. The object of the game is to guide Bugs through a series of rooms collecting carrots. However, four rascals are guarding the castle: Sylvester, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and Wile E. Coyote.
