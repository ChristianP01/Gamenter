Anno: 2021

Descrizione: No More Heroes III is a 2021 action-adventure hack-and-slash video game developed and published by Grasshopper Manufacture for Nintendo Switch. It is the fourth installment in the No More Heroes series and is the third mainline entry in the series. After an eleven-year hiatus since No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, the game stars professional assassin Travis Touchdown and follows his return to the fictional city of Santa Destroy, as he must defend the world from a powerful army of alien invaders led by the galactic overlord prince FU and his nine soldiers who adopt the fa√ßade of galactic superheroes.Development of the game began around the completion of the spinoff title Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes in early 2019, which served as a prequel. The series' creator and director Goichi Suda had received many fan requests to make a third entry in the series after the release of the second game, but development on a new entry would be postponed for many years due to Grasshopper Manufacture working on other projects such as Lollipop Chainsaw and Let It Die. Upon the studio being shown the Nintendo Switch, Suda was inspired to return to the series, believing the games would be a fit for the console's audience, and allow for a return to the series' staple motion control combat via the Joy-Con controllers. Much like previous entries in the series, the game pays homage to and parodies pop culture media, taking inspiration from works such as Rocky III, Kamen Rider, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the filmography of Takashi Miike. Suda has described the game as the conclusion of Travis Touchdown's story.No More Heroes III was announced at E3 2019 with a planned 2020 release, before being delayed into 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic slowing down development. Upon its release on August 27, 2021, the game was met with generally favorable reviews.
