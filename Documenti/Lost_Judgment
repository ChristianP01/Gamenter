Titolo: Lost Judgment

Anno: 2021

Descrizione: Lost Judgment is an action-adventure video game developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and published by Sega. It was released globally on September 24, 2021. A sequel to the 2018 game Judgment (a spin-off of the Yakuza series), the game focuses on private detective Takayuki Yagami as he investigates a criminal accused of both sexual harassment and murder. Alongside several of his friends, Yagami manages to see the links between the suspect Akihiro Ehara and his links with a series of murders committed against bullies in Kamurocho and Isezaki Ijincho. The game builds on the action sequences from the first game while revising its stealth elements. Yagami uses two returning fighting styles plus the new aikido-based Snake.
Lost Judgment is the directional debut of Kazuki Hosokawa who aims to make it superior to its predecessor from which he worked as producer while attempting to also create an appealing narrative. Major Japanese voice actors include the returning Takuya Kimura (Yagami) and the newcomers Hiroshi Tamaki (Soma) and Koji Yamamoto (Kuwana).
Like its predecessor, the game received positive reviews from critics. The plot was generally praised for handling multiple controversial subjects in a serious manner though the pacing and style was the subject of mixed responses. Nevertheless, Yagami and the cast were well received. The gameplay was also, primarily the new improved fighting styles, but the stealth and parkour moves were often noted to be poorly developed. Downloadable content in the form of new sidequests and a sidestory focused on Yagami's partner Masaharu Kaito is also being developed.
