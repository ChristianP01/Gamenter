Descrizione: Rambo: The Video Game is an arcade-style rail shooter video game developed by Polish studio Teyon and published by Reef Entertainment. The game is based on the Rambo franchise and puts the player in the role of John Rambo as he journeys through scenes from each of the three films: First Blood (1982), Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985) and Rambo III (1988).
A teaser trailer was released by Machinima, containing montages from the films. The game was originally set to release in winter 2013, but was eventually delayed to early 2014. The game was panned by professional critics, who criticized the poor quality of the graphics, the repetitive nature of the gameplay, and the overall lack of polish.
