Descrizione: Baseball Boss (also known as BaseballBoss and abbreviated to BBB) was a web based, free online MMOG (massively multiplayer online game) baseball game published by Challenge Games.  Baseball Boss is also an official licensee of Major League Baseball Advanced Media.  The game combined virtual baseball card collecting and fantasy baseball simulation through head to head completion against historical teams and other online players. The game was released on July 10, 2008.  Players were given cards of real baseball players from all of baseball's ages (card sets range from 1907 to the 2009 MLB All Star Game) to create teams of players using their cards.  Players then attempted to move up "classes," from Rookie to Hall of Fame by defeating other players' teams through simulated challenges.  Players spent tickets, earned for sending challenges to other teams, to purchase new packs of cards from the Market or new cards from other users in the Auction House.  Baseball Boss features two brands of cards, the "National" base brand and the "Spire" premium brand.  In addition to playing against other online users, Baseball Boss allowed users to collect entire sets or a group of their favorite cards in a way that resembled virtual baseball card collecting, using "Shoeboxes".Baseball Boss shut down operations on March 10, 2010 when the sponsor, Challenge Games, was unable to license certain rights from Major League Baseball.  In June 2010 Challenge Games was purchased by Zynga.
