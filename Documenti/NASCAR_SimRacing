Descrizione: NASCAR SimRacing, abbreviated NSR, is a computer racing simulator developed by EA Tiburon and released on February 15, 2005, by EA Sports for Microsoft Windows. The game includes all of the 2004 NEXTEL Cup Series drivers (including Jeremy Mayfield, who was absent from NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup) and tracks except Pocono Raceway, which was also absent from NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup, due to failed negotiations with licensing. Content from the 2004 NASCAR Busch Series (branded as "NASCAR National Series" in-game due to alcohol advertising regulations) and Craftsman Truck Series (excluding manufacturer branding in the latter) are also included.
The game features NASCAR's top 3 series, the NASCAR Cup Series, Busch Series, and Craftsman Truck Series. The game features a single-player career mode as well as multiplayer online gameplay. The game also features many paint schemes used during the 2004 and 2005 Cup Series; however the original release featured the 2005 cars replaced with their 2004 counterparts. This game was the last NASCAR game to be released for the PC by EA; the next NASCAR game for PC would be NASCAR The Game: 2013 by Eutechnyx.
