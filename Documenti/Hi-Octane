Titolo: Hi-Octane

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Hi-Octane is a racing and vehicular combat video game released in 1995 for the DOS, PlayStation and Sega Saturn, developed by Bullfrog, and based upon their earlier Magic Carpet game code.
It is notable amongst racing games for its wide and open tracks, and the resulting freedom offered to the player, and also for its excessive speed. It suffered in the marketplace due to thematic similarities with the better received Wipeout by Psygnosis and the generality of its graphics engine made for a very short depth of view compared to contemporary racing games.
Bullfrog later released an addon pack for Hi-Octane which included additional features made for the Saturn and DOS, including 3 new tracks and new game modes.
