Titolo: Space Dungeon

Anno: 1981

Descrizione: Space Dungeon is a multidirectional shooter released in arcades by Taito in 1981. Designed and programmed by Rex Battenberg, it was available both as a conversion kit and full arcade cabinet. An Atari 5200 port was released in 1983.
Like Robotron: 2084 (1982), but preceding the release of that game, the controls are a pair of 8-directional joysticks: one for moving, one for shooting. Space Dungeon is one of the first twin-stick shooters, released the same year as Mars from Artic Electronics.
