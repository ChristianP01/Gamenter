Titolo: Prodigy Tactics

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Prodigy Tactics (originally titled Prodigy) is a tactical role-playing video game developed by Hanakai Studio. The game features figurines representing characters in the game and uses cards to control their behaviors, such as attacking. Both cards and figurines are placed on a game board, with their position on the board influencing their powers and abilities. After an initial release date set in 2015 and not in 2016, the studio announced that Prodigy's release would be delayed due to an upgrade of its gameplay system.
A Kickstarter campaign to fund the game's alpha and beta phases began in April 2014, with a $100,000 funding goal. It reached its goal in just three days, eventually collecting $200,000 from over 1,000 backers. A incomplete version of the game was released on September 2018, physical goods from the Kickstarter campaign remain unfulfilled.
