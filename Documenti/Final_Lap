Titolo: Final Lap

Anno: 1987

Descrizione: Final Lap is a racing simulation video game developed by Namco and released in Japan in 1987. Atari Games published the game in the United States in 1988. It was the first game to run on Namco's then-new System 2 hardware and is a direct successor to Namco's Pole Position (1982) and Pole Position II (1983). A port for the Nintendo Famicom was developed by Arc System Works.
Final Lap was the first racing game to allow up to eight players to simultaneously race on the Suzuka Circuit in a Formula One race. This was, at the time, considered a revolutionary feature, and was implemented by linking together up to four two-player sitdown-style arcade cabinets. There was also a single-player mode, in which the player's score was based on how far the car traveled until time ran out or if the player completed four laps. It was a major commercial success in Japan, becoming the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1988, the highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1989, and second highest dedicated arcade game of 1990.
