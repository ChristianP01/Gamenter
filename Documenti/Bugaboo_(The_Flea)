Titolo: Bugaboo (The Flea)

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Bugaboo (The Flea), later published in Spain as La Pulga, is a computer game created in 1983   by the Spanish team of programmers Paco & Paco  for the ZX Spectrum.  Later versions for the Commodore 64, Amstrad and MSX were produced. Bugaboo, besides being the first video game made in Spain, is one of the first computer games to include cut scenes. Its publication marked the official beginning of the Golden Era of Spanish Software. It was ported to the Amstrad CPC under the name Roland in the Caves, to exploit the CPC's recurring Roland character. A sequel was released in Spain by Opera Soft under the title "Poogaboo", made by Paco Suarez, one of the authors of the original game. Paco Portalo, the other member of Paco & Paco, left the project after the publication of the original game for the ZX Spectrum.
The player takes control of a flea who has fallen into a cavern and must escape.
