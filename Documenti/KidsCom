Descrizione: KidsCom was a virtual world geared toward kids ages 8–14. KidsCom had many "worlds" (virtual places) that the user can go to in order to have fun with an avatar. It was a website for a long time dealing with new competition such as Webkinz. KidsCom was published by the now defunct Circle 1 Network, LLC in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and was first launched in 1995 as a site for kids. After receiving new capital in 2006, Circle 1 Network used those funds to enhance and expand KidsCom – a site that the company describes as safe, fun and educational.As a result of those funds, the virtual world was launched in 2007 and gathered over 2 million users. 
KidsCom primarily gave kids an opportunity to learn more about climate change while playing games, and making new friends. At its peak usage, it was praised for its dedication to both fun and learning, whilst teaching a new generation how to look after the Earth.The KidsCom website was taken offline in 2019 after the parent company, Circle 1 Network, ceased to renew the domain. Its virtual world is no longer accessible.
