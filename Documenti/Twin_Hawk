Titolo: Twin Hawk

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Twin Hawk is a 1989 vertically scrolling shooter arcade video game originally developed by Toaplan and published by Taito. Taking place at the end of an alternative World War II setting, where general Giovanni and his army plots to take over the fictional country Gorongo, players assume the role of a wing commander from the Daisenpū squadron taking control of a Flying Fortress fighter aircraft in an effort to overthrow the enemy.
Created by Yuichirō Nozawa, Twin Hawk was developed as a commission for Taito by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan and made use of the former's Taito X System board. Though it was initially launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to consoles including the Sega Mega Drive, PC Engine and PC Engine CD-ROM², with each one featuring several changes and additions compared to the original version.
Twin Hawk was met with mixed reception from critics since its initial release in arcades, as well as its home conversions. The rights to the title are currently owned by Tatsujin, a Japanese company formed by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge.
