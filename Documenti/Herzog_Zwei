Titolo: Herzog Zwei

Anno: 1989

Descrizione: Herzog Zwei (German pronunciation: [ˈhɛɐ̯tsoːk ˈtsvaɪ̯], German for "Duke Two") is a real-time strategy video game developed by Technosoft and published by Sega for the Mega Drive/Genesis. An early real-time strategy game, it predates the genre-popularizing Dune II. It was released first in Japan in 1989 and worldwide in 1990. It is the sequel to Herzog, which was available on the Japanese MSX and PC-8801 personal computers.
Herzog Zwei combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy. It has been cited as an inspiration to the developers of Warcraft, Starcraft, Dune II, and Command & Conquer. It is also considered a precursor to the MOBA genre.
