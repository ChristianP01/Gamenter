Titolo: Nintendo Puzzle Collection

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: Nintendo Puzzle Collection is a 2003 video game compilation published for the GameCube in Japan by Nintendo. It includes updated versions of three Nintendo-published puzzle video games released for older systems — Yoshi's Cookie (1992), Panel de Pon (1995), and Dr. Mario 64 (2001) — featuring updated graphics and music, alongside four-person multiplayer. The player can download one of the games to their Game Boy Advance via the GameCube - Game Boy Advance link cable.
Development was done by subsidiary Nintendo Software Technology, assisted by Intelligent Systems. Originally titled Masterpiece Puzzle Collection in early versions, the game was made to appeal towards women with the inclusion of Panel de Pon, leading to Nintendo using Japanese actress Asami Abe to promote the game through television commercials. A playable demo was presented at E3 2003 and slated for a release in North America and Europe, but was never released for unknown reasons.
Import reviews of Nintendo Puzzle Collection were favorable, being praised for its multiplayer and presentation, with several labeling Yoshi's Cookie and Panel de Pon as the best titles.
