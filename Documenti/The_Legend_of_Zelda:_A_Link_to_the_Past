Descrizione: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the third game in The Legend of Zelda series and was released in 1991 in Japan and 1992 in North America and Europe.
The story is officially set many years before the events of the first two Zelda games. The player assumes the role of Link as he journeys to save Hyrule, defeat the demon king Ganon, and rescue the descendants of the Seven Sages. It returns to a top-down perspective similar to the original The Legend of Zelda, dropping the side-scrolling gameplay of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It introduced series staples such as parallel worlds and items including the Master Sword.
Released to critical and commercial success, A Link to the Past was a landmark game for Nintendo and is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. It was ported to the Game Boy Advance as A Link to the Past and Four Swords in 2002; A Link to the Past sold 6.5 million copies across both platforms as of 2004. It was subsequently ported for the Wii, Wii U, and New Nintendo 3DS via the Virtual Console, and Nintendo Switch via Nintendo Switch Online. In 2017, Nintendo rereleased A Link to the Past as part of the Super NES Classic Edition. A spiritual successor, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, was announced and released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013.
