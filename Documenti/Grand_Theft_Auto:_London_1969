Titolo: Grand Theft Auto: London 1969

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Grand Theft Auto Mission Pack #1: London 1969 is an expansion pack for the 1997 action-adventure game Grand Theft Auto, developed by Rockstar Canada and published by Rockstar Games. It was released for personal computers (MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows) and the PlayStation in April 1999. The expansion adheres to the same gameplay mechanics of the main game and takes place in a fictionalised version of London during the 1960s. Like in the main game, players assume the role of a criminal who works for several London-based criminal syndicates, and complete levels by achieving a set score, within an open-world environment that allows them to do whatever they wish alongside jobs to achieve their goal. 
The expansion pack was met with mixed reviews, but won the 1999 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award in the "Sound" category. A second, freeware expansion, Grand Theft Auto Mission Pack #2: London 1961, was released exclusively for personal computers in July 1999, to coincide with the release of the Grand Theft Auto games on the internet. It is much shorter in length, and features the same map and characters as London 1969, but takes place eight years prior.
