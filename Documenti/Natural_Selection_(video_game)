Titolo: Natural Selection (video game)

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Natural Selection is a modification for the video game Half-Life. Its concept is a mixture of the first-person shooter and real-time strategy game genres. The game was created by Charlie "Flayra" Cleveland, who later founded the company Unknown Worlds Entertainment. Natural Selection v1 was first publicly released on Halloween 2002, and is now at version 3.2. Natural Selection 2 was released in late 2012.
The game features two teams: Kharaa (alien species) and Frontiersmen (human space marines).  The visible Kharaa "units" are actually simply the spawn of the real Kharaa (aliens) which are microscopic life-forms according to the storyline. The game was, in 2008, one of the ten most played Half-Life modifications in terms of players, according to GameSpy. On January 22, 2014 Unknown Worlds released the source code for download on a GitHub repository under GPLv3.
