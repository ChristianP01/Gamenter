Rearmed follows Nathan "Rad" Spencer, a commando with a bionic left arm that can extend and be used as a weapon, or to swing from various objects.  Spencer is sent to destroy a weapon known as the Albatross project under construction by the Badds.  The game was developed using Grin's Diesel engine and features in-game art by Shinkiro.

Rearmed was well-received by critics, who praised the updated gameplay, graphics and faithfulness to the original, with some calling it one of the best downloadable games available on the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. A sequel, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, was released in February 2011.
