Titolo: Eidolon (video game)

Anno: 2014

Descrizione: Eidolon is a first-person open world exploration video game with narrative and survival elements, developed and published by Ice Water Games. The game was released on August 1, 2014 for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
The player character travels through the wilderness and ruined cities of post-apocalyptic Western Washington, which is depicted using stylized, low-polygon graphics. While navigating this vast space, the player collects documents that reveal the stories of its previous inhabitants and the passing away of civilization; a key theme of the game is the potential for nature to outlast human activity. Although the player must obtain food and manage the risks of cold and injuries, these aspects of the gameplay were designed to be less challenging than in most survival games, to support a more relaxed mood and slower pace of exploration.
Eidolon obtained a mixed reception. While reviewers mostly appreciated its distinctive graphical style (which drew comparisons with Proteus) and its narrative, some criticised the gameplay as too slow-paced or repetitive.
