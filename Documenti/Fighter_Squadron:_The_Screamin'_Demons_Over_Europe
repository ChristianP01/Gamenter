Titolo: Fighter Squadron: The Screamin' Demons Over Europe

Anno: 1999

Descrizione: Fighter Squadron: The Screamin' Demons over Europe (SDOE) is a World War II themed combat flight simulator released for Windows 95/98 in March 1999. The game was developed by Parsoft Interactive and released by Activision, following their successful partnership on A-10 Cuba! of 1996. The game featured nine flyable aircraft and three theatres with multiple missions for each combination, as well as network play with up to sixteen players.
The game was originally scheduled to ship in 1998, a year that also saw the release of Jane's WWII Fighters and the very successful European Air War. The game was delayed several times, missing the release of these two games, and then the critical Christmas season. When it was released in early 1999 it sold poorly, in spite of some good reviews. Activision stopped working with Parsoft, and the company folded soon after.
