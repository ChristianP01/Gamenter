Titolo: A.E. (video game)

Anno: 1982

Descrizione: A.E. (sometimes shown unpunctuated as AE) is a fixed shooter written by Jun Wada and Makoto Horai for the Apple II and published by Broderbund in 1982. Versions for the Commodore VIC-20 (1983) and MSX (1984) followed. Unlike most earlier shooters which have a solid color or starfield background, the action in A.E. takes place in front of science fiction scenes. Attacking creatures emerge from points in the image, often appearing to come from behind objects. Combined with a slight scaling as they advance, there is the impression of depth.
According to the back of the box, "A.E. is the Japanese word for 'ray' as in Manta Ray or Sting Ray", robotic versions of which are enemies in the game.
