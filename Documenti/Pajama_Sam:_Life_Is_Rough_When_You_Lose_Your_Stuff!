Descrizione: Pajama Sam: Life Is Rough When You Lose Your Stuff! (also known as: Pajama Sam 4) is a computer game for children.Sam's Pajama Man comic book is lost in a strange world, where he meets a dirty sock who needs to get to his other sock, who is clean. He goes on a journey to find a way to clean the dirty sock and to find clothes (a shirt, shoes, and the socks) to get to Grubby Corners Mall, where his comic has found its way to. In this game, Pajama Sam's voice is provided by Elisha Ferguson rather than Pamela Adlon. This is the only Pajama Sam game without a demo, possibly because the game was only released after Atari's takeover along with Putt-Putt: Pep's Birthday Surprise.
