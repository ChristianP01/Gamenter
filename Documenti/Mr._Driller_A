Titolo: Mr. Driller A

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Mr. Driller A is a 2002 puzzle video game developed and published in Japan by Namco for the Game Boy Advance. The fourth installment in its Mr. Driller series, players control one of seven characters and must make it to the bottom of the level by destroying colorful formations of blocks. A adds several new mechanics to the gameplay of its predecessors, such as a virtual pet named the "Pacteria" that players can grow and care for.
Created by series producer Hideo Yoshizawa and Namco's Contents & Technology Creator Group, A was developed as part of a partnership between Namco and Nintendo where the former would create a GameCube game that made use of the GameCube â€“ Game Boy Advance link cable. The game was in development alongside its GameCube counterpart Mr. Driller Drill Land, allowing A to borrow several of Drill Land's concepts and ideas. Though it was well-received for its gameplay and additions to the Mr. Driller concept, A was a commercial failure and struggled to gain sales. The game has since been re-released for Japanese mobile phones and the Wii U Virtual Console.
