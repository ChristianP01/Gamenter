Titolo: Preppie! II

Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Preppie! II  is a video game written by Russ Wetmore for the Atari 8-bit family and published by Adventure International in 1983. Subtitled "The continuing saga of Wadsworth Overcash," it is a sequel to 1982's Frogger-inspired Preppie!. It loosely follows the preppy theme, primarily through a story in the manual, but replaces the country club setting with an abstract, overhead view maze. Some obstacles from the first game appear in the second.
In 2016, Wetmore made the source code for Preppie! II publicly available.
