Anno: 2012

Descrizione: Mass Effect 3: From Ashes is a downloadable content (DLC) pack developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for the 2012 action role-playing video game Mass Effect 3. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 as a standalone download on March 6, 2012, and included with all retail copies of Mass Effect 3: Special Edition for Wii U. Set within the Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century, From Ashes follows Commander Shepard and the crew of The Normandy as they investigate an attack on the colony of Eden Prime by the anthropocentric terrorist group Cerberus, where a Prothean artifact had recently been unearthed. 
From Ashes is the first major downloadable content pack for Mass Effect 3. It provides additional background lore and war asset mechanics, a new party member (or "squadmate"), a new weapon type, and new cosmetic outfits for playable characters. While From Ashes received a generally mixed critical reception from video game publications, the decision to release the pack as paid DLC alongside the launch of Mass Effect 3 has been the subject of controversy.
