Titolo: Malice (2004 video game)

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Malice is a platform game for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 developed by Argonaut Games and published by Mud Duck Productions in North America and Evolved Games in Europe. The game was originally supposed to be a title for the PlayStation. It was ported and management aimed to release it in late 2001 as an Xbox launch title with band members from No Doubt doing various voice-overs and singer Gwen Stefani doing the voice for Malice. After a lengthy delay, cancellation, a change in publishers and an eventual revival, the game was released in 2004 and was met with mediocre reviews. This was Argonaut's final title released, as the company went out of business two months after the Xbox version came out in Europe.
