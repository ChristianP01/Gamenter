Descrizione: Dark Room Sex Game is a rhythm-oriented party video game released on the Internet in February 2008 for Windows and MacOS. It was designed and developed by a team of seven students of various nationalities. Subtitled "Can I touch your Wiimote?", it is presented as a sex game without graphics. The game runs on a fully black screen, and the gameplay is based solely on sound information and haptics. A player needs to find a rhythm with his partner, and gradually accelerate to a target frequency, representing the orgasm. The game is playable with a keyboard or the Wiimote, and supports up to four players. 
Dark Room Sex Game was developed by students at the IT University of Copenhagen for the Nordic Game Jam. It was a competition of developing a game in a weekend, with the theme "Taboo." The basic idea of the team is that "a play on the most erotic sex would be so devoid of any visual, forcing players to use their imagination". The game received positive reviews from the press, saying that the judge was "very fun." It is considered an interesting title for the evolution of video games, because of its unique approach to sex in the gameplay. It won several awards, including the IndieCade 2008.Part of the team went on to create the indie game studio KnapNok Games, with Douglas Wilson forming his own studio Die Gute Fabrik.
