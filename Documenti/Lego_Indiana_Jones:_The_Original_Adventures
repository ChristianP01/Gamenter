Descrizione: Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is a Lego-themed action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts. The game allows players to recreate moments (albeit more humorously) from the first three Indiana Jones films: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). It features the same drop in/out co-operative play mode as seen in the Lego Star Wars video games, although it is restricted to local console play. The game was released on 3 June 2008 in the United States and Canada, and 6 June 2008 in Europe. A downloadable demo for Windows was made available on 13 May 2008. This game is based on the Lego Indiana Jones toy line. The Mac OS X version of the game was released on 4 December 2008 by Feral Interactive.As introduced in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, new moves include clinging onto branches during a jump using Indy's whip. As a promotion, Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga features Indiana Jones as an unlockable playable character.The game often follows the events in the films, however like the Lego Star Wars series, some scenes from the film have been altered to allow co-op (Satipo does not die so multiplayer mode could reenact the boulder scene), become more family friendly, or just provide comic relief to the player.
