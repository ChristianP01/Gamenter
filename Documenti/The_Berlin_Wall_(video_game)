Titolo: The Berlin Wall (video game)

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: The Berlin Wall (released as Berlin no Kabe (ベルリンの壁) in Japan) is a 1–2 player platform arcade video game released by Kaneko in 1991; two years after the fall of the actual Berlin Wall. A Game Gear version was also released exclusively in Japan; this version was going to be released in North America, but was canceled.The player takes control of a young boy who must use his hammer to break the blocks that form part of the platform levels comprising each stage. These holes act as falling traps for the many patrolling, multi-coloured monsters and once one has fallen into a hole, the player may then use the hammer on the monster to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below – causing it to transform into fruit or power-ups, which can then be collected and used. Part of the money earned from sales of the arcade version went towards a relief fund for disaster victims through the Japanese Red Cross Society.The game bears a number of similarities to Space Panic, a game generally considered as the first platform video game.
