Descrizione: Motor Raid (モーターレイド) is a racing video game released by Sega on its Model 2A arcade system board in 1997.

Game modes include "Championship" and "Practice" and there are four playable characters, Geila, Gunz, Io and Robin.
Unlike other Model 2A racers like Manx TT Superbike and the original Sega Rally Championship, Motor Raid was not ported to the contemporary Sega Saturn or Windows 95. In 2018, it was made playable on consoles for the first time via an in-game arcade machine in the Yakuza spin-off Judgment.
