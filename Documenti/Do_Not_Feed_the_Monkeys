Titolo: Do Not Feed the Monkeys

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Do Not Feed the Monkeys is a 2018 video game developed by the Spanish company Fictiorama Studios and published by Alawar Premium. It casts the player as a spy who monitors multiple live video feeds via an in-game desktop computer. The player gathers information about people and objects caught on these feeds, while managing life simulation elements such as the player character's health and apartment rent. Although the player is told not to interact with the people under surveillance, it is possible to do so, which provides bonuses but endangers the player character.Fictiorama conceived Do Not Feed the Monkeys around the time that it completed its debut game, Dead Synchronicity. Hoping to explore the concept of voyeurism, the team drew inspiration from the film Rear Window and the website Insecam, which allows users to view unsecure surveillance camera footage from around the world. According to Fictiorama's Luis Oliv√°n, the company's chief goal with Do Not Feed the Monkeys was player immersion coupled with a sense of agency. Nevertheless, the game also provides social commentary on issues related to mass surveillance and social media.
