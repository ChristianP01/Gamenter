Anno: 2019

Descrizione: The Dark Pictures Anthology: Man of Medan, also known simply as Man of Medan, is a 2019 interactive drama survival horror video game developed by Supermassive Games and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It is the first out of eight planned installments in The Dark Pictures Anthology, a series of standalone horror video games made and published by the same companies. Taking place in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean near French Polynesia, Man of Medan focuses on four college students and the captain of the boat Duke of Milan who embark on a diving trip in pursuit of the remains of a WWII-era plane. After a hostile encounter with a group of pirates, the five protagonists are forced by said pirates to sail the seas and search for something called the "Manchurian Gold", subsequently coming across what seems to be a ghost ship where they encounter visions of phantom creatures. Shawn Ashmore stars as the game's leading actor, playing one of the diving squad's members named Conrad.
Man of Medan was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 30 August 2019. A second game in the anthology, Little Hope, was released on 30 October 2020, and its successor House of Ashes was released on 22 October 2021.
