Descrizione: Tecmo Bowl (Japanese: テクモボウル, Hepburn: Tekumo Bōru) is an American football video game developed and released by Tecmo. Originally released as an arcade game in 1987, the game featured a large dual screen cabinet and allowed up to four players to compete in a match between two fictitious teams. A port for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in 1989 and was the first console game to include real National Football League players, via a license from the NFL Players Association. A Game Boy version developed by Sculptured Software followed in 1991. The NES version of the game was extremely popular, spawning various sequels, starting with 1991's Tecmo Super Bowl. The NES game has also been cited by various media outlets as one of the best sports video games ever made. Both the NES and arcade versions have also been re-released (sans the NFLPA license) for various platforms, including mobile phones, the Virtual Console, the NES Classic Edition and Nintendo Switch.
