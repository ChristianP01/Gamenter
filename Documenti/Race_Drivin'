Titolo: Race Drivin'

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Race Drivin' is a driving arcade game that invites players to test drive several high-powered sports cars on stunt and speed courses. The game is the sequel to 1989's Hard Drivin' and was part of a new generation of games that featured 3D polygon environments. Unlike most racing games of its time, it attempted to model real world car physics in the simulation of the movement of the player's car. Like Hard Drivin', the game is unique among video games in that it includes a true force feedback steering wheel, an ignition key, a four-speed shifter, and three foot pedals: an accelerator, a brake, and a clutch (the clutch being a control seldom seen in any video game, then or now). Released in August 1990, approximately 1200 units were produced at the time of its release for roughly $9000 each.Race Drivin' was ported to a number of home systems in the mid-1990s, including the SNES, Amiga, Game Boy, Genesis and Saturn. In 2005 it was included in the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 collection for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox.
