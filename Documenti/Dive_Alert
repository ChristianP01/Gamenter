Descrizione: Dive Alert: Becky's Version and Dive Alert: Matt's Version are role-playing video games developed by Sacnoth for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. They were published by SNK in 1999 in Japan and 2000 in North America. Following the exploits of protagonists Becky and Matt as they complete missions on a flooded Earth to gain access to the remaining land of Terra, the gameplay involves the protagonist completing missions fighting monsters and underwater crafts. The Japanese version is compatible with the console's Wireless Link adaptor for online multiplayer ad-hoc matches, while the Western version is limited to use of the console's link cable.
Sacnoth, a development partner for the console, produced the Dive Alert games in parallel with Koudelka for the PlayStation. Staff included character designer Miyako Kato, co-composer Yoshitaka Hirota, and Koudelka staff member Satoru Yoshieda as director. Dive Alert was Sacnoth's debut title in Japan. Its North American release was delayed due to difficulties releasing the Wireless Link in the region. It saw generally negative reviews from critics, with many faulting its design and small duration despite innovative gameplay concepts.
