Titolo: Trek-80

Anno: 1976

Descrizione: Trek-80 is a text-based video game written by Steve Dompier in 1976 and sold by Processor Technology for their Sol-20 computer and suitable S-100 bus machines.
Trek-80 combines features of the seminal Star Trek game by Mike Mayfield with the unrelated Trek73. In contrast to the originals, which were designed to run on teletypes, Trek-80 used the VDM-1 video card to produce a character-based real-time display.
Compatible 3rd party versions of the VDM-1 became the de facto display for most early S-100 bus machines, as well as the TRS-80. A version known as Invasion Force was sold by Tandy for the TRS-80.
An unrelated Trek-80 for the TRS-80 was sold by Judges Guild, but this was a port of the original Mayfield game with few changes.
