Descrizione: Blacksad: Under the Skin is a 2019 adventure video game developed by the Spanish company Pendulo Studios and published by Microïds. It is an adaptation of the Spanish comic series Blacksad by Juan Díaz Canales and Juanjo Guarnido. The game follows John Blacksad as he investigates the suspicious death of a boxing club owner.
Blacksad is Pendulo's first game based on a license and its first to use fully 3D graphics. The project began in late 2016 at the suggestion of Microïds, part of the same media conglomerate that owns Blacksad publisher Dargaud. It was released on November 14, 2019, although a technical error caused an unfinished version of the game to launch in Europe on November 5. A Nintendo Switch port of the game was released on December 10, 2019.
