Descrizione: Heros: The Sanguine Seven (also known as Heros I: The Sanguine Seven and Heroes: The Tantalizing Trio) is a platform game that was released for DOS, by Jeffrey Fullerton in July 1993. The game features EGA/VGA graphics, PC Speaker sound effects, Sound Blaster FM music tracks, and 360Â° of smooth parallax scrolling.
Originally self-published by Jeffrey Fullerton, a shareware version called Heroes: The Tantalizing Trio was later published by Safari Software.
The game bears similarities to many other platform games of the time such as Duke Nukem and Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure, but has some distinctive features. The most notable one is the ability to play as seven different "super heroes" each with their own abilities, weaknesses, and strengths.
In June 2005, Jeffrey Fullerton released the full version of Heros: The Sanguine Seven as freeware for personal use. The game can be downloaded free of charge at his homepage.
