Descrizione: Assassin's Creed Syndicate: Jack the Ripper is a downloadable content (DLC) expansion pack developed and published by Ubisoft for the 2015  action-adventure video game Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Set in London, England during the year 1888, Jack the Ripper explores the purported untold circumstances surrounding the brutal murders of several female prostitutes who lived and worked in the East End of London between 31 August and 9 November 1888, and the true identity of their murderer. The pack follows two player characters who oppose each other: Evie Frye, a member of the Brotherhood of Assassins, and a fictionalized version of the titular historical figure, depicted as a mentally disturbed renegade Assassin within series lore. Jack the Ripper's goal is to subvert the legacy of his estranged mentor Jacob Frye, while Jacob's sister Evie attempts to stop his reign of terror as well as the criminals he has rallied to his cause. 
Jack the Ripper is the first major post-launch DLC pack for Syndicate released on various platforms in December 2015. It has a standalone story campaign that is loosely connected to the base game's narrative, but largely retains its central mechanics. American musician Bear McCreary composed the game's soundtrack, replacing Austin Wintory, the composer used for the base game. Reviews for the Xbox One version by video game publications were predominantly positive, whereas the PlayStation 4 version was met with a mixed reception.
