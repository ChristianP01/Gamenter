Descrizione: Armored Core: Project Phantasma is a 1997 third-person shooter mecha video game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation. Project Phantasma is the second entry in the Armored Core series and a prequel to the original Armored Core. The game was not released in Europe.
The story is set 2 years before the original Armored Core and follows the player's investigation of the mysterious Amber Crown complex, a testing ground for the shadowy Doomsday Organization and their dangerous research codenamed Project Phantasma. The player encounters an escaped prisoner named Sumika, who guides her as the two are targeted by a vicious rival named Stinger.
Gameplay is largely identical to Armored Core with the addition of new weapons and customization options available to the player. Players can import save files from the original game to continue their progress and use parts that are only present in the original's in-game shop. An Arena mode is included in the game, which would later be expanded in Armored Core: Master of Arena.
