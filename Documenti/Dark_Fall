Titolo: Dark Fall

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: Dark Fall is a 2002 first-person psychological horror/adventure game developed and independently published for Microsoft Windows by Jonathan Boakes, under the XXv Productions label. After the independent release proved a success, with the game selling well and generating good word-of-mouth, The Adventure Company purchased the rights, releasing it worldwide in 2003 under the title Dark Fall - The Journal. The game was re-released twice in 2009. Firstly, by Boakes' own company, Darkling Room, in a limited "Pins & Needles" edition, and later by Iceberg Interactive, as part of their Adventures in Terror: British Horror Collection. The game was made available on Steam in December 2013.The game tells the story of an unnamed protagonist who receives a frightened message from his brother asking for help. Encountering an ancient evil known as the Dark Fall, which traps souls between the realm of the living and the dead and feeds off their pain, the protagonist must attempt to imprison it before he too is overcome by its power.
Dark Fall received mixed reviews with critics praising the individual work put into the game by Boakes and finding the tone of the game unsettling. Common criticisms included poor graphics and an over-reliance on finding notes to progress the story. The game was followed by three further Dark Fall games. Dark Fall II - Lights Out tells an unrelated story to the first game, although it does feature a recurring minor character. Dark Fall - Lost Souls also tells a relatively unrelated story, although it is set in the same location and features several of the supporting characters from the original game. Dark Fall - Ghost Vigil tells a new story, featuring a ghost hunting paranormal team investigating Harwood House, but reflects game play elements from Dark Fall - The Journal, whilst also connecting The Lost Crown game by the same author.
