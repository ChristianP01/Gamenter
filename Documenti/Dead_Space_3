Development of the game began after the completion of Dead Space 2. It is the only game in the Dead Space series to feature online co-op.
The game received generally positive reviews from game critics upon release; reviewers praised the game's rewarding action gameplay, as well as its atmosphere and visuals, although criticism was directed at the focus on action over horror, as well as a weak, unfocused story compared to its predecessors and the use of microtransactions. Despite poor sales, EA and Visceral expressed interest in a sequel. However, Visceral Games was shut down in 2017, shelving a fourth installment in the series. Instead, a remake of the first game is now being developed by Motive Studios.
