Titolo: MIDI Maze

Anno: 1993

Descrizione: MIDI Maze is a networked first-person shooter maze game for the Atari ST developed by Xanth Software F/X and released in 1987 by Hybrid Arts. The game takes place in a maze of untextured walls. The world animates smoothly as the player turns, much like the earlier Wayout, instead of only permitting 90 degree changes of direction. Using the MIDI ports on the Atari ST, the game is said to have introduced deathmatch combat to gaming in 1987.  It also predated the Lan party concept by several years. The game found a wider audience when it was converted to Faceball 2000 on the Game Boy.
