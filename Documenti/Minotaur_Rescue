In 2010, Jeff Minter started what he called "the Minotaur Project": a series of games, each embracing the style of a particular 8-bit game system, but without the hardware restrictions that made designing games for them difficult. Minotaur Rescue is the first in the series, and is the Minotaur Project game representing the Atari 2600.In 2016, Llamasoft pulled out of the iOS market, and its games, including Minotaur Rescue, are no longer available via the iOS App Store.
