Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Jumping Flash! 2: Big Trouble in Little Muu (Japanese: ジャンピングフラッシュ! 2 アロハ男爵大弱りの巻, Hepburn: Janpingu Furasshu! Tsū: Aroha Danshaku Ō Yowari no Maki) is a first-person shooter platform video game developed by Exact and MuuMuu and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation in 1996. It is the direct sequel to Jumping Flash!, which was released the previous year. It was later re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via the PlayStation Network in 2009.
The game revolves around the robotic rabbit Robbit as he searches for lost MuuMuus, which are scattered throughout different levels in the game by Captain Kabuki. Robbit must explore each expansive new world to recapture all the lost MuuMuus. As with its predecessor, the game is presented in a first-person perspective. Much of the interface was transferred from the first Jumping Flash! to the second in order to save time during development. New features include a much longer draw distance, updated enemy AI and a meter displaying whether or not Robbit can triple-jump.
Similar to its predecessor, Jumping Flash! 2 was well received by critics, who praised the game for its updated interface, advanced graphics and gameplay. However, also like its predecessor, it was criticised for its short length, lack of challenging gameplay and close similarities to the first game. Despite this, Jumping Flash! 2 gained enough popularity to spawn a final sequel, Robbit Mon Dieu.
