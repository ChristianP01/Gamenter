Citadel is the final major downloadable content pack for Mass Effect 3. It received very positive reviews from video game publications, who praised its humorous tone and focus on character interactions and relationships, although some criticism was aimed at the pack's reliance on fan service. Many critics described it as a "love letter" to the series, and felt that it was the best downloadable content pack of Mass Effect 3. Citadel was nominated for Best DLC at the 2013 VGX Awards, but ultimately lost to Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.
