Titolo: Buzz! Junior: Robo Jam

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Buzz! Junior: Robo Jam is a 2007 family game for the Sony PlayStation 2, and is the second game in the Buzz! Junior series of games. Gameplay comprises multiple mini-games, each quite simple and straightforward to play using the four Buzz! controllers. It is primarily aimed at the family market but offers appealing entertainment to almost anyone of any age. Simple game play allows young children to participate while still being entertaining enough for older children and adults. The game is similar in concept to Jungle Party, with robot based mini-games in a space-themed environment. One of the main differences between Jungle Party and Robo Jam is the introduction of AI, allowing players to play against the computer. Unlike Jungle Party there is no solo game mode. A full game can be played with only one human player and three computer players.
Buzz! Junior: Robo Jam won the 2007 Children's Jury Giga Maus award.
