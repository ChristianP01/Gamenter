The game had 4 airlines, a minimum of one of which was human controlled, with the rest being computer-controlled. The game begins with the year set as 1970 and as time progresses more aircraft models become available, corresponding with their first flights in reality.
The aircraft in the game used real aircraft names, illustrations and model specifications, unlike most other airline simulation games.
