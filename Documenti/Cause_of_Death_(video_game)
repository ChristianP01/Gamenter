Descrizione: Cause of Death: Can You Catch the Killer? was a video game developed and published by EA Mobile for iOS and macOS devices on December 16, 2010 that was removed from the App Store in September 2014. While being almost identical in gameplay, the game is intended for a more mature audience than its companion game, Surviving High School, as the game revolves around crime and serial killers and their pursuit by law enforcement (and its text depicts some rather graphic and suggestive things at times). The suggested age on the App Store was 12+. Cause of Death is a visual novel that is divided into a series of volumes, each of which is made up of eight chapters (excluding the first, fourteenth and sixteenth volumes). The base game (which was free from the App Store came with the entire first Volumeâ€”future content needed to have been downloaded either by "Episodes on Demand" or "Now Airing". The first 6-episode volume was released in December 2010, and the series released its final episode in July 2014, and the game was unlisted from the App Store in September 2014.
