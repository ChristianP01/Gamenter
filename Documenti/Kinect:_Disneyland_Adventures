Titolo: Kinect: Disneyland Adventures

Anno: 2011

Descrizione: Kinect: Disneyland Adventures is a 2011 open world video game developed by Frontier Developments and published by Microsoft Studios on Kinect for Xbox 360, with a remaster for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows developed by Asobo Studio released in 2017. It takes place in a recreation of Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California circa 2011, with themed games in place of many of the rides, while motion controls are used (required in the original release) to play the game.
In addition to minigames based on various Disneyland attractions, the game allows players to take photos of their avatars at the park, and meet and greet characters. The characters appear in their normal proportions, as if animated, as opposed to appearing as a costumed character. Outdoors at the park are characters including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Daisy Duck, and Chip 'n' Dale. Other Disney characters appear within the minigames, such as Tinker Bell from Peter Pan as she appears in the Disney Fairies franchise and Nemo from Finding Nemo.
In August 2017 at Gamescom 2017, Microsoft announced a remastered version of the game for Xbox One and Windows 10 developed by Asobo Studio with updated visuals, 4K resolution, support for the Xbox One's Kinect sensor, and the ability to play the game with traditional controls using an Xbox Wireless Controller or (on Windows only) a mouse and keyboard. The new version was released on October 31, 2017 as Disneyland Adventures, removing the Kinect branding from the title. On September 14, 2018, the Windows version was released for Steam and retail discs, adding support for Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 along with Windows 10.
