Titolo: JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade

Anno: 2002

Descrizione: JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade is a personal computer game created by Knowledge Adventure. It replaced the previous JumpStart 2nd Grade released in 1996. As its name suggests, it was made to teach second grade students. From 2003â€“2008, it was distributed as the "Fundamentals" disc in a 3- or 4-disc package of the same name, though recently a factory error in some packages caused the Fundamentals disc to be replaced by JumpStart 3D Virtual World: The Quest for the Color Meister going by the same name.
Like the original version, this game prominently features the frog C.J. and his sidekick Edison the firefly, but also includes characters from other JumpStart games, such as Hopsalot the rabbit, who originally appeared in JumpStart Kindergarten, as well as Frankie the dog who first appeared in JumpStart 1st Grade.
Additionally, the plot is more complex than the original and involves an anthropomorphic snail called Dr. O doing evil deeds, such as vandalizing "Mount Jumpmore" (parody of Mount Rushmore) by painting moustaches on all the faces. The JumpStart characters (in the form of the "JumpStart Intelligence Agency", or J.I.A.) must fix up the damage Dr. O causes. Hopsalot makes plans for a machine he calls the "Soapy Shooter" which will clean up the graffiti. However, he lacks the parts he requires to build it. Thus, C.J., Edison, and the player of the game travel to different continents, playing games to earn "gadget pieces". After the player plays another game in order to make the machine work, Dr. O causes another problem, requiring the user to go on another quest for gadget pieces to make Hopsalot's machines work; there are six different missions total, including inflating the island on which C.J.'s house rests (as Dr. O deflated it), ridding a schoolhouse of worms which infest it thanks to Dr. O, and thawing out a river after Dr. O turns the water into ice cubes.
