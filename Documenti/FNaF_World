Descrizione: FNaF World is an indie role-playing video game created by Scott Cawthon. It is the first official spin-off to the Five Nights at Freddy's series and the fifth game overall. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on January 21, 2016 and Android on January 12, 2017, but came with unfinished gameplay and a large amount of bugs, leading to bad reception and ultimately the decision for the game's removal from digital storefronts.
