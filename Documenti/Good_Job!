Titolo: Good Job!

Anno: 2020

Descrizione: Good Job! is a 2020 puzzle video game developed by Dutch developer Paladin Studios and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch console. The player controls a megacorporation CEO's son in completing exaggerated office tasks in destructive playground-style puzzles to climb the corporate ladder. Although there are normal ways to complete the levels, the player can be as destructive and creative as they like to beat the level faster.
After good impressions from both companies, Nintendo and Paladin Studios met together to create an experimental game. They had the intentions of appealing to a broad audience, using time zones and locations to their advantage. The game was announced and released in March 2020. The game received generally positive reviews, with reviewers praising the exaggerated gameplay and office setting.
