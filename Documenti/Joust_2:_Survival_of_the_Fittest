Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest is an arcade game developed by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is a sequel to Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.
John Newcomer led development again, which began to create a kit allowing arcade owners to convert an existing cabinet into another game. The original Joust used a horizontal monitor, but Williams chose a vertically oriented screen for the kit as a result of the design's popularity at the time.
Released during the waning days of the golden age of arcade games, Joust 2 did not achieve the success that Joust reached. The game was not ported to contemporary home systems, but was later released as part of arcade game compilations.
