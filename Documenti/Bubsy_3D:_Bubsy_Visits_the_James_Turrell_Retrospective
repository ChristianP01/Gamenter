Titolo: Bubsy 3D: Bubsy Visits the James Turrell Retrospective

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Bubsy 3D: Bubsy Visits the James Turrell Retrospective is a browser-based 3D platform video game developed by indie game developer Arcane Kids. Touted as an educational experience, it is a facetious spiritual successor to Bubsy 3D, an entry from the Bubsy series of video games, and was created as a tribute to the game for its 18th anniversary. The game follows Bubsy Bobcat as he travels through a nightmarish scenario upon visiting the real-life retrospective tribute of postmodern artist James Turrell. It was released in autumn 2013 â€“ shortly after the domain name for Bubsy 3D's official website had expired. In 2017, in addition to making a downloadable version of the game available due to the fading support of the browser version of Unity, a remastered version of the game was made available with high-definition graphics and a new epilogue following Bubsy reminiscing over the events of the game and meeting his older self.
