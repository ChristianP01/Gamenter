Titolo: Popful Mail

Anno: 1991

Descrizione: Popful Mail: Magical Fantasy Adventure (ぽっぷるメイル, Poppuru Meiru) is a side-scrolling platform game developed by Nihon Falcom. It was originally released for the NEC PC-8801 home computer in 1991 and the PC-9801 in 1992. The game was later ported to the PC Engine CD-ROM by NEC Home Electronics, to the Sega CD by Sega, to DoJa mobile phones by Bothtec, and to the Super Famicom and Microsoft Windows by Falcom.
After the failed attempt to bring the game to the west by reworking it to be the part of Sonic the Hedgehog series, the Sega CD version of the game was localized by Working Designs and released in North America in late 1994. Most versions of Popful Mail are for the most part similar to each other, but the Super Famicom and Sega CD versions differ significantly both from each other and from the previous releases.
