Descrizione: Puppeteer (パペッティア) is a platform video game developed by Japan Studio for the PlayStation 3. It was directed by Gavin Moore. The game was released worldwide in September 2013.
It is playable in both traditional 2D and in 3D. Gavin Moore says Puppeteer plays better in 3D than other games because the camera does not move and his team used a method of 3D that has not resulted in a reduced framerate.
