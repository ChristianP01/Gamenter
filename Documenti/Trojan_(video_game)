Titolo: Trojan (video game)

Anno: 1986

Descrizione: Trojan (闘いの挽歌, Tatakai no Banka, literally "Requiem for Battle") is a side-scrolling action game produced by Capcom, originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1986, and distributed in North America by Romstar and Capcom. Directed by Takashi Nishiyama, the game includes beat 'em up and hack-and-slash elements. It is a spiritual successor to the beat 'em up Kung-Fu Master (1984), which was designed by Nishiyama at Irem before he left for Capcom, where he evolved its gameplay concepts with Trojan. It is also considered a spiritual successor to Capcom's Ghosts 'n Goblins (1985), which has similar side-scrolling action gameplay elements.A Nintendo Entertainment System port was released the same year. It included a one-on-one fighting game mode, for the first time in a Capcom game, making it a precursor to Nishiyama's work on Capcom's Street Fighter (1987). A version for MS-DOS was also released during the same year. A ZX Spectrum version was programmed by Clive Townsend for Elite Systems in 1987 for their Durell publishing line of games, but was never released; a ROM has since been leaked from a collection of Townsend's ZX Microdrive disk files. The arcade version was later included in Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The NES version was rereleased in 2016 for the Wii Virtual Console, but only in Japan.
