Titolo: Clockwork Knight 2

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Clockwork Knight 2, known in Japan as Clockwork Knight: Pepperouchau's Adventure - Last Volume (クロックワーク ナイト ～ ペパルーチョの大冒険・下巻～), is a side-scrolling platform video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn. It is the sequel to Clockwork Knight, a title also released for the Sega Saturn, and features virtually identical gameplay mechanics. Despite this, many critics deemed it a dramatic improvement over its predecessor, citing improved replay value and pacing. A second sequel, the working titles for which included Clockwork Knight 3: Pengin War and Clockwork Knight Puzzle, used gameplay similar to the Bomberman series, but never made it past the beta stage. Another sequel, titled Knight N' Knight, was scheduled to appear on the GameCube, but never released.
