Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Blade Force is a 1995 third-person shooter simulation video game developed by Studio 3DO and published by The 3DO Company in North America, Europe and Japan exclusively for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Set on a dystopian sci-fi future in the year 2110, where the fictional city of Meggagrid has been overrun by criminals, the player is equipped with a flight suit created by scientist Dr. Franz Grubert known as the HeliPak in an attempt to overthrow the main criminal organization led by the Pitt family and bring order back to the metropolis.  Its gameplay mainly consists of shooting action in third-person with six degrees of freedom using a main five-button configuration.
Headed by Electronic Arts and The 3DO Company founder Trip Hawkins alongside Gregory A. Gorsiski and Robert Lindsey, Blade Force was created by most of the same team that were previously involved with several projects at Studio 3DO such as Jurassic Park Interactive and features a 3D game engine created by Pinball Construction Set designer Bill Budge.
Blade Force has been met with mostly positive reception from video game magazines and other dedicated outlets that reviewed the game since its launch, with praise towards the presentation, texture-mapped polygon graphics and sound design, though some reviewers criticized other aspects of the title such as the gameplay.
