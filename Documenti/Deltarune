Titolo: Deltarune

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: Deltarune is a role-playing video game developed by Toby Fox. The player controls a teenage human, Kris, who is destined to save the world together with Susie and Ralsei. During their quest to seal the "Dark Fountains", the group meet the inhabitants of the "Dark World", some of which try to stop them. The combat system is based on bullet hell attacks the player must dodge. Similarly to Undertale, enemy encounters can be resolved peacefully or through violence. 
Development of Deltarune began in 2012, three years before Fox's previous game Undertale was released. Though it shares some narrative elements with Undertale, the game's battle system was overhauled to more closely resemble the combat of the Final Fantasy series. The first chapter of the game was released for free on October 31, 2018, for Microsoft Windows and macOS; the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 editions were released on February 28, 2019. The second chapter was eventually released for free on the same platforms in September 2021. Three more chapters are planned as a paid release, but no release date has been announced yet. The game was generally praised by critics for its soundtrack, characters, and sense of humor.
