Titolo: Capitán Sevilla

Anno: 1988

Descrizione: Capitán Sevilla is a 1988 platform video game developed by the Spanish group Hi-Score and published by Dinamic Software for the Amstrad CPC, MSX and ZX Spectrum. In the game, players assume the role of Mariano López, a transporter-turned superhero after eating a radiation-affected blood sausage to fight against the mad scientist Torrebruno and protect Earth.
Capitán Sevilla was conceived during the golden age of Spanish software under the working title Capitán Morcilla by director Álvaro Mateos, who developed titles published by Dinamic Software such as Rocky and West Bank (1985), and formed Hi-Score as a game development group dedicated to microcomputers with royalties obtained from his previous works. The idea originated from a comic strip by artist Angel Tirado during his high school days and the project initially started on the ZX Spectrum but went through a turbulent development cycle before its eventual launch to the market.
Capitán Sevilla proved to be unsuccessful when it was published across Europe but received positive reception from critics across all platforms since its release; praise was given to its originality, audiovisual presentation and addictive gameplay but criticism was geared towards the high difficulty level and ending sequence. In recent years, fans have since experimented with remaking and porting the title to other platforms.
