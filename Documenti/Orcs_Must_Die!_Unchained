Titolo: Orcs Must Die! Unchained

Anno: 2017

Descrizione: Orcs Must Die! Unchained was the third installment in the Orcs Must Die! franchise from Robot Entertainment, available for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4. Unchained was initially released as a beta version in 2014, and in its release form on April 18, 2017 for the Windows platform, while the PlayStation 4 version was released on July 18, 2017.As with the previous titles, Unchained is a variation on tower defense games, where the player places traps within the game's levels and engages in direct combat with a selected hero characters to ward off several waves of orcs and other monsters from reaching a magic core. While the game was available to purchase during its beta period, Unchained was released as a free-to-play title with a meta-game for players to earn in-game currency and upgrades through successful matches to improve traps and acquire other items and attributes to support their character, or which they can buy directly using real world money. The game includes co-operative matches for up to three players against AI opponents, and a competitive mode between two teams of three, competing on separate instances of the map but with the ability to affect the other team's performance; the game previously featured a competitive, 5v5 player-versus-player mode named Siege that was dropped during the beta phase.
Robot Entertainment shut down the game's servers in April 2019, after running the game at a financial loss for several months.
