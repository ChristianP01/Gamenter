Titolo: Glider (video game)

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Glider is a Macintosh game written by John Calhoun and first published as shareware in 1988 under the company name Soft Dorothy Software. In 1991, a colorized version of Glider that included a level editor was published by Casady & Greene as Glider 4.0. A version of Glider 4 for Microsoft Windows was released around 1994. In 1994, Casady & Greene published a further enhanced version of the game, Glider PRO, for the Mac platform. When Casady & Greene went bankrupt in 2003, the rights to the series reverted to the author, who opted for a period of time to give the game away on his website.The object of the game is to fly a paper plane through the rooms of a house. Air currents from heat ducts and fans affect the plane's movement, while assorted household objects are usually deadly. Some rooms have special mechanics, such as the ability to slide along grease-covered surfaces. Each room is presented as a two-dimensional side view.
Calhoun wrote several other Macintosh games, such as Glypha, Pararena, and Stella Obscura, but Glider was the most popular.
