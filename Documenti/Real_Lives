Descrizione: Real Lives is a 2001 educational video game designed by Educational Simulations and now taken over by Neeti Solutions, Pune, India. The third version of the game is currently running after including player feedback in its development. It allows players to live out lives of randomly generated people on Earth. Players are allowed to choose their occupation, living conditions, social activities, and start families, but all their decisions are affected by available statistical real data. For example, if your character was born a girl in India, a database of Indian girl's names would be consulted as well as a database of Indian last names, Indian cities, Indian health statistics, etc. Throughout the game player's lives can be affected by random events such as floods, outbreaks of war, disease, car accidents and other major life changing events. Players get to play from the moment of birth until they die. Older features from the 2010 edition include a three-dimensional face for the player character and his or her relatives, the ability to start a business as an alternative of finding jobs and Google Maps connectivity.
Different countries mean different possibilities for their citizen. In reality, there is no choice whether one is born into a wealthy family or a poor one. Similar rules apply to your innate talent and other skills. Yet, everyone seeks happiness regardless of their situation but this can prove difficult depending on the country, skills and family wealth. By putting yourself in a different life situation, the game aims to provoke questions about life and empathy towards other people in the user.
