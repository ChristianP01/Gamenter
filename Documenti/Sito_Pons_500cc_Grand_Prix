Titolo: Sito Pons 500cc Grand Prix

Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Sito Pons 500cc Grand Prix is a 1990 racing video game developed and published by the Spanish company Zigurat Software (previously known as Made in Spain) for Amstrad CPC, MS-DOS, MSX and ZX Spectrum. Featuring former Spanish racer Sito Pons and themed around motorcycle racing, the game pit players driving the Honda NSR500 with races against AI-controlled opponents across various countries to qualify in the 500cc class of the Grand Prix motorcycle racing.
Sito Pons 500cc Grand Prix was created in conjunction with Carlos Sainz: World Rally Championship at the end of the golden age of Spanish software by most of the same team at Zigurat who worked on previous licensed sports titles such as Paris-Dakar (1988) and Emilio Sanchez Vicario Grand Slam. Zigurat approached Sito Pons to act as endorser due to their local market and motorsports being a hobby among Zigurat staff. Conversions for Amiga and Atari ST were planned but never released. 
Sito Pons 500cc Grand Prix was met with mostly positive reception from critics across all platforms since its release; praise was given to the graphics, realism and sense of speed but criticism was geared towards the high difficulty level and sound design. The title was included as part of the Pack Powersports compilation for all platforms in 1991.
