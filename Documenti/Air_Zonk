Descrizione: Air Zonk, known in Japan as PC Genjin Series PC Denjin (PC原人シリーズ PC電人), is a horizontally scrolling shooter released for TurboGrafx-16 in 1992. Air Zonk was an attempt to update the company's image via a modern, punkish character called Zonk, who bears a purposeful resemblance to the TurboGrafx-16's caveman mascot, Bonk.
The game was developed by Red Company, the original creators of the Bonk series, also known for their Gate of Thunder series. Air Zonk features King Drool, antagonist of the Bonk series, along with many other enemies from the series. It was followed by a sequel in 1993 called Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly-Paradise for the TurboDuo, and has been released on the Wii's Virtual Console.
