Titolo: Mario Kart 64

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Mario Kart 64 is a 1996 kart racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 (N64). The game is the second entry in the Mario Kart series and is the successor to Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was first released in Japan on 14 December 1996, in North America on 10 February 1997 and in the United Kingdom on 24 June 1997. It was later released as a Virtual Console game for the Wii, Wii U, and on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service in 2007, 2016, and 2021, respectively.
Changes from the original include the move to polygon-based true 3D computer graphics for track design, and the inclusion of four-player support. Players take control of characters from the Mario franchise, who race around a variety of tracks with items that can either harm opponents or aid the user. The move to three-dimensional graphics allowed for track features not possible with the original game's Mode 7 graphics, such as changes in elevation, bridges, walls, and pits. However, the characters and items remain 2D pre-rendered sprites. The game was commercially successful and was generally praised for the fun and high replay value of its multiplayer modes, though some critics regarded it as a disappointment compared to Super Mario Kart.
