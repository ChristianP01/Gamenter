Titolo: Cold War Conflicts

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Cold War Conflicts is a real-time strategy game developed by Russian studios Fireglow Games and Red Ice software, set in the historical period of the Cold War era from 1950 to 1973. In four campaigns you take control of the military forces of eight nations (United States, Israel, Egypt, North Korea, United Kingdom, Syria, USSR and China). Some of the campaigns are non-linear which means that success or failure in some missions results in a different starting point and strength of military forces in the following mission. The game is designed to present an accurate account of battlefield warfare, so most missions must be accomplished using a limited number of available units and supplies; the focus is on real military strategy and tactics, instead of resource gathering and base development.
