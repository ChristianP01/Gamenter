Descrizione: Armored Core: Last Raven is a 2005 third-person shooter mecha video game developed by FromSoftware for the PlayStation 2. It is the eleventh entry in the Armored Core series and a direct sequel to 2004's Armored Core: Nexus. In 2010, Armored Core: Last Raven was ported to the PlayStation Portable.
Last Raven concludes the storyline that began with 2002's Armored Core 3. The previously warring corporations have merged into a single organization called The Alliance, while a group of mercenaries called Vertex rise to oppose them. The player takes the role of an unaffiliated mercenary, a Raven, and is given the option of which faction to support, leading to several distinct endings.
Gameplay remains largely unchanged from the game's predecessors and is centered around piloting a large mech in combat missions for various clients. As players complete missions, they can earn credits to purchase new parts and items to further customize their mech.
