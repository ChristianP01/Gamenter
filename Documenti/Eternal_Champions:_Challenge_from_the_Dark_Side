Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side (also known as Eternal Champions 2 or Eternal Champions CD) is a fighting video game for the Sega CD. It was published in June 1995 in North America and during the same year in Europe, within the waning days of the platform lifespan.
The game is a semi-sequel to the Sega Genesis game Eternal Champions and was part two of a proposed trilogy of games by Sega. Both games were developed by an internal team at Sega Interactive Development Division and designed by Michael Lantham, a developer with Sega of America from their early days.
Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side includes the nine playable fighters and non-playable boss from the first game, and adds 13 new playable characters (nine of which are hidden) and a new boss. Also, new moves called "Cinekills" were added, which are essentially fatality scenes rendered in full motion video.
