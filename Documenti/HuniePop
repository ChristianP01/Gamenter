Titolo: HuniePop

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: HuniePop is a tile-matching and dating sim adult video game created by American game designer Ryan Koons, under the alias of HuniePot. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux-based personal computers in January 2015, after being funded via a successful Kickstarter campaign. HuniePop is available in two different versions, an uncensored version available via Humble Bundle and MangaGamer, and a censored version via Steam. The game follows the dating adventures of the main character as they try to woo several different women in their home town.
In February 2015, Koons released an update that gave HuniePop a new ending that unlocks options that make it easier for players to fill out a female character's profile and select date locations, among other options. Due to its strong sexual content and themes, Twitch blocked users from streaming gameplay footage of the title, regardless of which version of the game was being played.
