Titolo: Space Encounters

Anno: 1980

Descrizione: Space Encounters is a 1980 arcade game by Bally Midway. The game recreates the trench flying scene from Star Wars with the player in a TIE fighter at the bottom of the screen shooting at waves of enemies flying down from the top. Moving graphics provided the illusion of an isometric 3D view, but the action was in 2D.
The game is otherwise notable for being the first Midway machine to be released in a cabaret-sized cabinet, what they referred to as their "mini myte" line.
