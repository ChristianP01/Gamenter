Titolo: Denki Blocks!

Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Denki Blocks! is a puzzle video game developed by Denki and originally released in 2001 by Rage Games for Sky Gamestar and the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. In the game, players manoeuvre different coloured blocks around a grid to join those of the same colour together. The game features versus modes for multiple players. Denki Blocks! was ported to the PlayStation Portable in 2011 by Tiger Games, and to Android the same year and iOS in 2010.
Many features had to be added to meet price requirements. Denki Blocks! was released in the United States in 2002 by Majesco Entertainment. The game received positive reviews, with critics praising the gaily coloured graphics, but a major criticism of the iOS version was the lack of an online leaderboard.
