Titolo: Mutant Storm Reloaded

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Mutant Storm Reloaded is a multi-directional shoot 'em up developed by PomPom Games. The game debuted as a launch title on the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service with updated graphics, sound, and gameplay over its Windows and Xbox predecessor, Mutant Storm.
The game's core is very much that of a classic arcade shooter, although its artistic design, colorful and reminiscent of cel-shading or microscopic medical imaging, has been called "psychedelic" and "an eye-frying Minter-esque slice of psychotropic twitch brilliance" by reviewers. Generally, reviews were positive, with the most common complaint being the game's high launch price, 800 Microsoft Points ($10 USD), compared to similar alternatives available on Xbox Live Arcade.
