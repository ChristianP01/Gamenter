Descrizione: Mobile Suit Gundam: Lost War Chronicles (機動戦士ガンダム戦記, Kidō Senshi Gundam Senki) is a Sci-Fi Mech Shooter/Mech Simulator Game for the Sony PlayStation 2. This game allows the user to play as a regular soldier on either the EFSF or the Principality of Zeon, witnessing events from the One Year War on a grunt unit's point of view. The user is able to fight side by side with the Ace pilots as they make cameo appearances on certain missions. Getting a high rank on a certain key mission unlocks a mobile suit (usually the strongest one featured on that episode). Suits from Mobile Suit Gundam to Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory appear in the game. Music from the game was composed by Takanori Arima and Koji Yamada.
A manga version has also been published by Kadokawa Shoten and in North America by Tokyopop.
