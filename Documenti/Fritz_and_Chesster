Titolo: Fritz and Chesster

Anno: 2009

Descrizione: Fritz and Chesster (German: Fritz und Fertig) is a series of educational programs about chess for children. In each of the four PC games, Fritz White and his cousin Bianca learn chess with the help of the anthropomorphic rat Chesster. In the first three games, they learn various elements of chess before competing against King Black in a chess game; the fourth game is set on an alien planet. The first game teaches the rules of the game, along with some basic checkmates and strategy. The next games teach opening theory, tactics, middlegame analysis and endgames, along with checkmate patterns. Other games feature chess variants, chess puzzles or timed games with highscore boards.
The programs were produced in Germany for Terzio and Chessbase between 2003 and 2009; they have been translated into 17 languages. Reviewers found the first two games entertaining and commented on the lengthiness of the storylines. Chess puzzle books and workbooks featuring the characters have been produced.
