Descrizione: Amnesia Fortnight 2014 is a bundle of prototypes made during a two-week public prototyping session in 2014 by Double Fine Productions, which was held in conjunction with Humble Bundle in 2014.  Everyone that paid a minimum of $1 had the opportunity to vote on 23 concept ideas from employees, and $7 to vote on one of four ideas from Adventure Time creator Pendleton Ward. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top three concept ideas from employees and the top one concept from Pendleton voted ideas into game prototypes that became available to those that purchased the bundle after they were completed. 2 Player Productions filmed a documentary about the making of the prototypes, which was included on Blu-ray with purchase of the bundle if you donated $35. The documentary was also released on YouTube.
