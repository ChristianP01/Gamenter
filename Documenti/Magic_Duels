Titolo: Magic Duels

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Magic Duels (originally titled Magic Duels: Origins) is a video game based on the popular collectible card game Magic: The Gathering. Magic Duels is a successor to Stainless Games' Magic: The Gathering â€“ Duels of the Planeswalkers and its annual sequels, released from 2009 through 2014. The free-to-play title was released on July 29, 2015, shortly following the physical release of the Magic Origins core set.
The gameplay follows that of the card game, but includes a story mode that follows the origin story of five of the game's Planeswalkers. This is the first game in Stainless' series to feature free-form deck construction and the ability to build a card library using both in-game rewards and microtransactions to purchase new cards and boosters. The game includes single player modes and online battles with other players.
Wizards of the Coast pulled the game from sale and discontinued in-game storefront features in November 2019, though the game remains playable.
