Titolo: The Eye of Judgment: Legends

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: The Eye of Judgment: Legends is a turn-based card battle video game for the PlayStation Portable. It is a spinoff of the 2007 PlayStation 3 release The Eye of Judgment. Unlike the original game, Legends uses a completely virtual card system rather than having the player own physical cards. With that in mind, it does not use the PSP's camera attachment.
