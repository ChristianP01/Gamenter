Titolo: Metal Slug Anthology

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Metal Slug Anthology (called Metal Slug Complete (メタルスラッグコンプリート) in Japan) is a video game compilation for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, PC and the Wii. The Wii version boasts different controller configurations, most taking advantage of the Wii Remote, with the Japanese version supporting the Classic Controller and all regional variants supporting the GameCube controller. The game also marks the return of SNK Playmore as a third-party developer for a Nintendo console since the SNES era.
The graphics are virtually the same as the original versions released on arcade (and the more recent titles published on PS2 and Xbox). The only major change is that all games now display at a converted 480i resolution (compared to the standard 240p). Cooperative gameplay is enabled on the console versions of the game, while the PSP version has a wireless mode so that two people can play together and work as a team.
A downloadable version was made available on the PlayStation Store for PSP on October 1, 2009. The Metal Slug Anthology was then released on PC in 2009 under the name Metal Slug Collection PC. However, this version offers less contents and an alternative menu interface. It was also released on PlayStation Store for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in 2015 and 2016 respectively.
