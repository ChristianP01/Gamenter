Titolo: Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York

Anno: 2019

Descrizione: Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York is a visual novel-style adventure video game developed and published by Draw Distance. It is based on the tabletop role-playing game Vampire: The Masquerade, and part of the larger World of Darkness series. It was released in 2019 for Microsoft Windows, and in 2020 for Linux, MacOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The stand-alone expansion Shadows of New York followed in 2020.
The player takes the role of one of three fledgling vampires of different vampire clans with different vampiric abilities, and interacts with the members of their coteries. The story depicts the struggle between two vampiric factions, and diverges based on player choices.
The game was designed by Krzysztof Zięba, who also was one of the writers, and used the tabletop game's sourcebook New York by Night as its main inspiration and reference for the characters and setting, while also taking influence from the use of moral dilemmas in the video games developed by Telltale Games. In adapting the tabletop game, the developers chose not to incorporate many of its game mechanics, and focused on what they considered essential for storytelling.
