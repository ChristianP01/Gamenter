Titolo: Through the Looking Glass (video game)

Anno: 1984

Descrizione: Through the Looking Glass, also known as Alice, was a 1984 video game written for the Apple Lisa and Apple Macintosh computers. Written by a member of the Lisa and Mac teams, Steve Capps, it was one of the earliest video games on the Mac platform, part of the only games disk officially sold by Apple Computer during that era.
In the game, the player takes the role of Alice from Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice in Wonderland, who is opposed by the computer playing a complete set of chess players. Alice moves about the board in realtime while attempting to capture the computer's pieces, while at the same time avoiding the computer's attempts to capturing her. To increase the skill level, Alice's moves are increasingly limited, while the computer increases the number of players it actively moves.
The game was re-released for iOS on the 25th anniversary of the Mac's release.
