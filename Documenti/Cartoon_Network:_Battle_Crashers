Anno: 2016

Descrizione: Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat 'em up video game based on multiple Cartoon Network series developed by French studio Magic Pockets and published by GameMill Entertainment in the North American release and Maximum Games in the European release. It was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo 3DS on 8 November 2016. A Nintendo DS version was also going to be released but was cancelled, as GameMill Entertainment's page for the game shows a cover for a Nintendo DS version. The game features characters from various Cartoon Network shows, including Adventure Time, The Amazing World of Gumball, Clarence, Regular Show, Steven Universe, and Uncle Grandpa.
The game received extremely negative reviews from several video game journalists, who panned it as a repetitive and boring beat 'em up with bland representations of otherwise unique characters. A port for the Nintendo Switch was released on 31 October 2017.
