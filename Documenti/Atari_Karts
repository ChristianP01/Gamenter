Titolo: Atari Karts

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Atari Karts is a kart racing video game developed by Miracle Designs and published by Atari Corporation exclusively for the Atari Jaguar first in North America on December 15, 1995 and later in Europe on December 22 of the same year. It is one of the first titles developed by Miracle Designs and its gameplay is similar to the Mario Kart series, where items are placed at predetermined points in the tracks.
In Atari Karts, players take control of one of the seven characters available including Bentley Bear, the protagonist of the 1983 arcade game Crystal Castles, with each one having different capabilities. In single player mode, players race against computer-controlled characters in multi-race cups over four levels of difficulty and during the races, speed boosting and other power-ups can be used to gain an advantage while in multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups. It features numerous homages to the history of Atari and its games.
Atari Karts received mixed reception when it was released. While it received praise for its graphics, sound and controls, many were divided in regards to the gameplay and others criticized its lack of offensive power-ups during both single and multiplayer modes, and lack of variety. Critics also compared the game with Super Mario Kart, which was released three years prior on the SNES. Although it never received a direct sequel, Miracle Designs would go on to develop multiple kart racing titles such as Merlin Racing for the Nuon and Rascal Racers for the PlayStation, which are considered spiritual successors to the game. Retrospective reviews for the title have been equally divisive in recent years.
