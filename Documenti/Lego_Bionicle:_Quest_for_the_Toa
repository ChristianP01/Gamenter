Anno: 2001

Descrizione: Lego Bionicle: Quest for the Toa (also known as Lego Bionicle and originally titled Lego Bionicle: Tales of the Tohunga) is an 2001 action-adventure game developed by Saffire and published by Lego Software for the Game Boy Advance. Based on the Lego Group's Bionicle line of constructible action figures, the game follows Takua, a villager on the island of Mata Nui, on a quest to rescue the island's Turaga elders and summon the Toa, heroic elemental warriors destined to defeat the evil Makuta.
The game incorporates elements of platform games and takes an isometric perspective; the player traverses through 20 levels, divided among the six elementally-themed regions of the island of Mata Nui. After completing each world, a minigame is unlocked that can be played in single-player or multiplayer. Quest for the Toa was originally designed to be a prequel to Lego Bionicle: The Legend of Mata Nui, a planned PC title developed by Saffire that would ultimately be canceled shortly before release. During development, the game's name was changed from Tales of the Tohunga to Quest for the Toa due to complaints from the MƒÅori people of New Zealand. Upon its release, Quest for the Toa received mostly negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing its controls and gameplay. Conversely, praise was directed towards the minigames and graphics.
