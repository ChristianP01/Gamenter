Anno: 1992

Descrizione: Air Rescue is a Sega arcade action game released in 1992, which runs on the Sega System 32 hardware. A Master System game of the same name was released later in 1992, but had little in common with the arcade version.

The arcade version of Air Rescue has a first-person perspective, while the Master System version is side-scrolling. The Master System version only came out in PAL territories.
