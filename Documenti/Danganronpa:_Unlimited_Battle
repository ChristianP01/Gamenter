Titolo: Danganronpa: Unlimited Battle

Anno: 2015

Descrizione: Danganronpa: Unlimited Battle is an action video game in the Danganronpa series, developed and published by Spike Chunsoft. It was released in Japan for iOS and Android platforms in early 2015, and ceased operations later that year. The gameplay involved using the touchscreen to shoot the characters from the player's team, as with billiards, towards enemies in a confined arena-like area. The game is free to play, and features in-game currency purchased through microtransactions, used to gain access to new content or get advantages in gameplay.
Video game journalists questioned the choice to use the Danganronpa series to create a touchscreen-based action game, but still felt that it should be given a chance; one noted however that the game retained the style of the previous games in the series, and one called it unusually good for its genre. By May 2015, over 700,000 user accounts had been registered for the game.
