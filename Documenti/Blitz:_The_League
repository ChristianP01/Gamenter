Titolo: Blitz: The League

Anno: 2005

Descrizione: Blitz: The League is an American football video game developed and published by Midway Games as an extension of their NFL Blitz series. It was released in October 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox after the National Football League (NFL) signed an exclusive licensing deal with Electronic Arts. Lawrence Taylor, who provides voice acting for the game, serves as its official spokesman. A second version of the game was released on the Xbox 360 in 2006â€“2007. In December 2006, a portable version titled Blitz: Overtime was released on the PlayStation Portable. These versions included the voicework and likeness of former NFL linebacker Bill Romanowski. The game was originally intended to be a Wii launch title, but the version was delayed and eventually canceled.The Xbox 360 version, which had been planned for release in Australia on February 23, 2007 (the day before its European release date), was refused classification by the country's Office of Film and Literature Classification, effectively banning the game there. The reason for the ban was that the use of drugs was related to incentives and rewards. Blitz: The League, Blitz: The League II, and Mutant Football League are the only professional football games ever to receive the "Mature" rating from the ESRB.
