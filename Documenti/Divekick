Descrizione: Divekick is a 2D competitive fighting game originally developed by One True Game Studios, an independent collective of competitive gamers. A demo of the game was showcased at several competitive events, and after a positive reaction, the group created a Kickstarter campaign to fund the creation of a full version for release on Microsoft Windows. The Kickstarter project was canceled after it was announced that developer Iron Galaxy Studios had agreed to co-develop and release the game.The name "Divekick" is a reference to a common mechanic in many fighting games in which some characters can jump in the air and do a diving kick with a sudden increase in momentum. In fighting games, dive kicks are usually very powerful, abusable tactics. The gameplay in Divekick revolves entirely around this mechanic. Various aspects of the game, such as its character roster, also serve to satirize other fighting games and fighting game community culture. The game was released for PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows via Steam Greenlight on August 20, 2013 in English-speaking regions. The game was released in Japan on September 17, 2014.A major balance update to the game, titled Divekick: Addition Edition, was released in April 2014, and a port of the game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, titled Divekick: Addition Edition +, was released on October 7, 2014.
