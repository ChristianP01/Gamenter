Titolo: G-Nome

Anno: 1997

Descrizione: G-Nome is a mech simulation video game developed by 7th Level. Publisher difficulties led to it having a protracted development cycle. Originally intended to be published by Merit as a DOS-based title, it was ultimately released on February 28, 1997, as 7th Level's first 3D game. Reviews upon release were unenthusiastic, as critics found that while the main selling point (that characters could leave their mechs and commandeer others) was innovative, the overall execution of the game was weak. G-Nome was followed up by a real-time strategy spin-off called Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3, developed by 7th Level, but acquired and released by Ion Storm.
