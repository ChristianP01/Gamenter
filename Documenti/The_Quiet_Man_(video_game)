Titolo: The Quiet Man (video game)

Anno: 2018

Descrizione: The Quiet Man is an action-adventure beat 'em up video game developed by Human Head Studios and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4. The game's story is told through lengthy full motion video sequences, some of which feature live-action actors, inserted between the gameplay sequences, and it features a deaf protagonist, which is reflected by having most of the events except for the opening and ending scenes having heavily muted sound with no subtitles regardless of the settings, being a deliberate choice from the developers.
The Quiet Man was critically panned upon its release, with the complaints stemming from issues with the story, the underdeveloped gameplay sequences, and the lack of commitment displayed towards the deafness gimmick, with the inconsistent portrayal of the protagonist's deafness and the game's cinematics being realized in a sound film way that would not work without sound like a proper silent film would. In response, the audio was restored in a post-release update as an optional feature.
