Titolo: Deep Scan

Anno: 1979

Descrizione: Deep Scan is an arcade game released in 1979 by Sega. The game involves commanding a battleship which patrols the ocean. The object is to destroy as many enemy submarines as possible by dropping mines from either the left or right side of the ship, while avoiding mines launched from these submarines. The game has a radar on the bottom of the screen, a feature that would be popularized by Defender two years later, as well as full RGB color graphics, which was still a new feature in 1979. Some arcade cabinets bundle the game with Invinco, a Space Invaders clone released by Sega in the same year.
A port to the Atari 2600 was published in 1983 as Sub-Scan.
