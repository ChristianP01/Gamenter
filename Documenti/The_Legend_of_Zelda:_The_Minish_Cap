Descrizione: The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is an action-adventure video game and the twelfth entry in The Legend of Zelda series. Developed by Capcom and Flagship, with Nintendo overseeing the development process, Minish Cap was released for the Game Boy Advance in Japan and Europe in 2004 and in North America and Australia  the following year. In June 2014, it was made available on the Wii U Virtual Console.
Minish Cap continues the story of the Four Sword, a weapon introduced in Four Swords and Four Swords Adventures. The game retains many elements common to previous Zelda games, especially top-down predecessors such as A Link to the Past, and includes new features and mechanics. Chiefly, the protagonist Link acquires a magical talking cap named Ezlo, who can shrink Link to the diminutive size of a Minish. 
Minish Cap was well received among critics. It was named the 20th best Game Boy Advance game in an IGN feature and was selected as the 2005 Game Boy Advance Game of the Year by GameSpot.
