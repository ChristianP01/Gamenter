Titolo: Pixter

Anno: 2000

Descrizione: Pixter was among the first portable handheld touch screen drawing toys for children invented by Rehco, LLC and marketed by Fisher Price from 2000 through 2007. 
Pixter was pre-programmed with fun content and repeatable play. Pixter also could accept cartridge-based games and other activities. Pixter was originally marketed successfully with a black-and-white display but later was upgraded to a color display.
The Pixter line has become something of an obscurity, with little information left on the internet about the history of it, sales records, original pricing, release dates, etc.
The Pixter remains, as of 2017, the second to last console Mattel has ever released, after the HyperScan. However, Pixter is Fisher Price's first and only handheld game system.
