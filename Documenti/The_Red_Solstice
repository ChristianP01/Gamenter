Anno: 2014

Descrizione: The Red Solstice is a tactical shooter, survival game, developed and published by Ironward for PC. The game was released on July 10, 2014 through Steam's Early Access program. It is the first installment in The Red Solstice video game series. The Red Solstice had been in development for two and a half years. It uses an Ironward-created game engine, Razor.
In the year 117 AE (After Earth), a storm rages across the surface of Mars, a planet now colonized by humans driven from their home planet. Although terraforming is well under way, the alignment of the Martian northern winter solstice with the planet's closest approach to the Sun still triggers global dust storms sometimes lasting up to several weeks. During an exceptionally violent storm dubbed "The Red Solstice," the human colonies of Mars lose all contact with Tharsis, the colony referred to as "The Capital." Soldiers in the service of the Elysium Corporation, elite marine troops, were sent to find out what happened to the colony.
