Titolo: Fleet Defender

Anno: 1994

Descrizione: Fleet Defender is a combat flight simulator published by MicroProse in 1994. The game uses the F-14B version of the F-14 Tomcat, even in scenarios where it constitutes an anachronism, because the developers found that flying the original underpowered F-14A was very unforgiving and "not much fun" for a commercial flight simulator. An expansion pack, Fleet Defender: Scenario, and a port for the PC-98 were released in 1995.
Tommo purchased the rights to this game and digitally published it through its Retroism brand in 2015.
