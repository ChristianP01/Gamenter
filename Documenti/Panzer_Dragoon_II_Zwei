Titolo: Panzer Dragoon II Zwei

Anno: 1996

Descrizione: Panzer Dragoon II Zwei is a 1996 rail shooter game for the Sega Saturn, published by Sega and developed by Sega's Team Andromeda studio. It is the sequel to Panzer Dragoon (1995); it follows Jean-Luc Lundi, who rides a dragon he names Lagi. The player moves an aiming reticle (representing the dragon's laser and Lundi's gun) and shoots enemies while the dragon flies or runs through 3D environments on predetermined tracks.
Zwei began development in mid-1995 alongside Panzer Dragoon Saga (1998), with a staff of twenty people and little assistance from Sega. In response to player criticism, the team lowered the overall difficulty and expanded the story elements. The music, composed by Yayoi Wachi, influenced the musical direction of later entries.
Panzer Dragoon II Zwei released to positive reviews from journalists, with many praising it as superior to the original Panzer Dragoon in its gameplay, graphics and narrative. A remake for undisclosed platforms is currently in development, handled by MegaPixel Studio under license from Sega.
