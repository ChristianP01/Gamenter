Titolo: Lucienne's Quest

Anno: 1995

Descrizione: Lucienne's Quest is a role-playing video game developed by Microcabin for the 3DO, and is the sole traditional Japanese role-playing game released for the system. The story follows Lucienne, a teenage girl who sets off on an adventure to find a cure for a man's lycanthropy. Between adventuring from town to town and exploring the world, the player must battle with enemies using a turn-based battle system on an isometric grid.
Lucienne's Quest was first released in Japan in 1995 before being localized for a North American release the following year along with a Sega Saturn port in Japan. Critics gave mixed reviews. Some appreciated the game's  light-hearted story, simple game mechanics, and short length, but many found the experience unfulfilling compared to the deeper and more complex RPGs of the time. Lucienne's Quest is considered one of the best 3DO games in retrospect, and the North American release has become an expensive collector's item.
