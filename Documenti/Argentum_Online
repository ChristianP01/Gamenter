One day the idea of having dinner arose, to meet us all."The developers and fans worked together to create variants and mods of the game, by 2001 four different versions had been made.The game's source code was released in 2003 under the GNU GPL license and can be downloaded from SourceForge. This has caused many player-run servers to be created.
