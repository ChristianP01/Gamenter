Descrizione: Excitebots: Trick Racing, known in Japan as Excite Mou Machine, is a racing video game published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. Developed by Monster Games, it's the fourth game in the Excite series and the sequel to Excite Truck (2006). Excitebots was released on April 20, 2009 in North America. Excitebots features animal-themed robot vehicles and short minigames during racing, such as pie throwing, bowling and soccer. The game could be bought packaged with or without the Wii Wheel, similar to Mario Kart Wii.
Despite a positive reception from critics, the game was never available in stores outside North America. Nintendo Australia's Managing Director, Rose Lappin has said that Excitebots will not be seeing an Australian release "due to lack of interest". However, Japanese Club Nintendo members were able to exchange points for a copy starting from over two years of the original release date. A fifth game in the series, Excitebike: World Rally, was released in November 2009 for WiiWare.
