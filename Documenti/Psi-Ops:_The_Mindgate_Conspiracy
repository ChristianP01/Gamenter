Titolo: Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy is an action adventure video game developed by Midway Games for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows platforms. The game was released in North America on June 14, 2004; the European release followed on October 1, 2004.
A traditional shooter in many respects, Psi-Ops banks on its ragdoll physics (by way of Havok 2.0) and variety of psychic powers to differentiate itself. In the game, the player is Nick Scryer, a "PSI-Operative" whose mind has been wiped to allow him to infiltrate a terrorist organization. However, he is captured and must fight his way out with the help of Sara, a double agent. As he progresses, he regains his PSI powers.
On June 9, 2008, the full version was offered as a free download hosted by FilePlanet with in-game advertising, but also allowing to purchase the game in order to remove the advertising. A FilePlanet subscription is required to receive the game. On December 2018, the website MajorGeeks now hosts the PC game as freeware.
