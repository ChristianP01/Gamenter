Titolo: Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova

Anno: 2006

Descrizione: Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova (ダンスダンスレボリューションスーパーノヴァ, Dansu Dansu Reboryūshon Sūpānova), released in Europe as Dancing Stage SuperNova, is an arcade and PlayStation 2 game in the Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) series of music video games. It was produced by Konami and released through Betson Enterprises. The game was released in Europe on April 28, 2006, followed shortly by a North American release on May 15 and a Japanese release on July 12.
It is the first DDR game released for the arcades since Dance Dance Revolution Extreme three years before, although there had been steady releases of DDR games for consoles in the interim. Instead of Bemani System 573 Digital, the arcade version was built using the PlayStation 2-based Bemani Python 2, which results in higher-quality graphics and superior sounds than previous games. Unlike previous DDR arcade releases, all versions have the same features and song list. It is the ninth arcade release in Japan, the fifth arcade release in Europe, and the third arcade release in North America.
