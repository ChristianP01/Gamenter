Titolo: Fallout 2

Anno: 1998

Descrizione: Fallout 2 is a 1998 role-playing video game developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Productions. While featuring a considerably larger game world and a far more extensive storyline, it mostly uses similar graphics and game mechanics to those of Fallout which was released one year earlier. It was released on both Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows platforms.
The game's story takes place in 2241, 80 years after the events of Fallout (the first and original installment of the Fallout series) and 164 years after the atomic war which reduced the vast majority of the world to a nuclear wasteland. The plot tells the story of The Chosen One, (the grandchild of the Vault Dweller), and their quest to save their primitive, peaceful tribe from the small village of Arroyo, situated on the West Coast of the United States and founded by a wretched group of former residents from Vault 13 led by the Vault Dweller, from starvation by finding an ancient environmental restoration machine known as the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (GECK) in the ruins of the tribe's ancestral home. Upon completing the mission, however, The Chosen One discovers that their tribe has been conquered by the "Enclave", a group of marauders claiming to wield the authority of the former U.S. federal government, and must fight to save their people from enslavement and death.
In terms of critical acclaim, the game was well-received as well as tremendously praised for its gameplay, storyline, and as a worthy successor to the original Fallout, while the frequent bugs and lack of improvement over the first game attracted mild criticism on behalf of several gamer groups and gaming magazines.
