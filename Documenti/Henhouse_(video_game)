Anno: 1983

Descrizione: Henhouse is a 1983 video game produced by Funware for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A home computer system. In 1983 there were as many as three companies interested in buying out Funware, those being Activision, Epyx, and Creative Software. Funware was eventually sold to Creative Software. However, both Epyx and Activision would later market TI-99/4A games independently near the end of 1983. According to Michael Brouthers, it only cost Funware $4 US to make each game cartridge.
