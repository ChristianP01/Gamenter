Titolo: America's 10 Most Wanted

Anno: 2003

Descrizione: America's 10 Most Wanted, released as Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror in the US, is a first-person shooter game for the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows platforms. Developed by Black Ops Entertainment and released in 2004, it was mainly received negatively due to its dated graphics and uninspired boss battles as well as its immensely insensitive depiction of enemies. It contains tracks and cameos by members of So Solid Crew. The European and US versions differentiate slightly in level music and terrorist names with Saddam Hussein only being present in the European version. The European manual shows Mullah Omar as one of the terrorists despite being absent in both versions.
