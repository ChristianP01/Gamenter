Titolo: Redshirt (video game)

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Redshirt is a social simulation game developed by Mitu Khandaker, developing under the company name The Tiniest Shark, and published by Positech Games for Windows, MacOS, and iOS. The game follows the player's custom character as they work through a fictional social media account as they try to "climb the ladder" on a space station. The game's title refers to a redshirt, a stock character in fiction who dies soon after being introduced.
Mitu Khandaker was inspired to create Redshirt after her experience from working at a social media startup. The game received mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the game had mostly shallow mechanics, despite generally complimenting its successfully focused nature on what it was lampooning.
