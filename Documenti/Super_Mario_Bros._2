Descrizione: Super Mario Bros. 2 is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was first released in North America in October 1988, and in the PAL region the following year.Following the release of Super Mario Bros. (1985), Nintendo released a sequel, titled Super Mario Bros. 2, in Japan in 1986. However, Nintendo of America found the Japanese game to be too difficult and similar to its predecessor, and sought an alternative for release outside of Japan. This resulted in the creation of a new game based on Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic, a 1987 Family Computer Disk System game meant to tie-in with Fuji Television's media technology expo, called Yume Kōjō '87. The characters, enemies, and themes in Doki Doki Panic were meant to reflect the mascots and theme of the festival, and were adapted into characters from the Super Mario franchise in the new version. The original Japanese game was later released internationally as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels in 1993.: 2 Super Mario Bros. 2 was a commercial success, becoming the fifth-best-selling game on the NES, and was critically well-received for its design aspects and for differentiating the Mario series. It was re-released in Japan for the Famicom as Super Mario USA (1992), and has been remade twice, first as part of the Super Mario All-Stars (1993) collection for the Super NES, and later as Super Mario Advance (2001) for the Game Boy Advance.
