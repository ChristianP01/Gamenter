Titolo: Dead Space Ignition

Anno: 2010

Descrizione: Dead Space Ignition is a 2010 action puzzle video game co-developed by Visceral Games and Sumo Digital. It was published by Electronic Arts for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. A spin-off of the Dead Space series, it serves as a prequel to 2011's Dead Space 2. It is set on the Sprawl, a city built upon the remains of the moon Titan. The player takes the role of Franco Delille, an engineer who witnesses and navigates round the initial outbreak of the hostile alien Necromorphs. The gameplay combines hacking minigames with motion comic-style cutscenes featuring multiple story paths.
Production of Ignition was part of Electronic Arts's efforts at creating both a wider media franchise around Dead Space, and as part of a new marketing strategy of using small standalone video games to promote larger titles. Series composer Jason Graves and veteran writer Antony Johnston both returned to work on the game. It was offered as a free download with pre-orders of Dead Space 2, unlocking a new costume and story content within that game upon completion. Reception of Ignition was generally negative, with many faulting its art and gameplay compared to the rest of the series.
