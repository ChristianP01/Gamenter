Titolo: Mach Storm

Anno: 2013

Descrizione: Mach Storm is a 2013 combat flight simulation arcade game developed and published by Namco Bandai Games. The player controls a fighter craft, the leader of the Storm Squadron, in a mission to prevent a terrorist group from attacking major cities worldwide. Its gameplay involves destroying fleets of enemy fighters with a lock-on targeting system and avoiding collisions with their projectiles and level obstacles. Five levels are present, each taking place in famous cities such as Miami, Tokyo, and Washington D.C.
Directed by Kazushi Imoto with assistance from the Project Aces development division, Mach Storm is based on the company's Ace Combat franchise, specifically Ace Combat: Assault Horizon (2011), though it is not directly connected to the series. It was created for Namco Bandai's "P.O.D." arcade cabinet, which uses air blowers and vibrating seats to immerse the player in the game. Originally named Sonic Storm, the development team focused on making the game appealing towards a casual audience, using simplistic mechanics to create the feeling of flight. Mach Storm was well-received for its arcade cabinet and gameplay, and has been used to describe modern-day arcades and their focus on experiences that are unable to be recreated elsewhere.
