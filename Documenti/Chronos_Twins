Titolo: Chronos Twins

Anno: 2007

Descrizione: Chronos Twins is an action-adventure game developed by Spanish studio EnjoyUP Games, released in Europe on October 12, 2007. It was also released in North America on January 18, 2010 and in Europe on May 14, 2010 as a download for the Nintendo DSi system. The game puts a different perspective on time travel than most games. Instead of revisiting an area in two different times, both screens show the same setting during two eras as gamers explore the land with a present-day hero. Chronos Twins was originally planned for release for Game Boy Advance, but after the rise of the Nintendo DS, the game's development switched to that system. An enhanced version for the Wii console entitled Chronos Twins DX was released in North America as a WiiWare download one week prior to the Nintendo DSi release.  It was later released in the PAL region for WiiWare on April 2, 2010.
