Titolo: Metroid: Zero Mission

Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Metroid: Zero Mission is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 (R&D1) and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It is a remake of the original Metroid (1986), and retells the story with updated visuals and gameplay.
Like other Metroid games, the player controls bounty hunter Samus Aran, who travels to planet Zebes after learning that the Space Pirates are experimenting with Metroids, hostile parasitic creatures. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups to reach previously inaccessible areas. The remake adds items, additional areas, mini-bosses, difficulty levels and a rewritten story that explores Samus's past.
Zero Mission received acclaim for its new content, graphics, gameplay and improvements over the original, though it received minor criticism for its short length. The game received several honors, including a 46th-place ranking in a list of the Top 200 Games compiled by Nintendo Power. It was also named the ninth-best Game Boy Advance game by IGN. It had sold over 439,000 units in the United States and 69,000 in Japan as of February 2005. The game was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on June 19, 2014, in PAL regions on March 12, 2015, and in North America on January 14, 2016.
