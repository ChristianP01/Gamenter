Descrizione: Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator (alternatively known as Five Nights at Freddy's 6) is a freeware point-and-click business simulation survival horror video game developed and published by Scott Cawthon. The game was released on December 4, 2017 on Steam and Game Jolt. It is the sixth main installment of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series, the seventh game overall, and is chronologically set after the events of the third game. Initially marketed as a simulation game where the player manages their own franchised pizzeria, the game gradually reveals itself to continue its predecessors' concept of surviving against hostile animatronic characters for multiple nights in a row.

Unlike the PC version, the mobile release, which is developed and published by Clickteam LLC USA, is pay-to-play. A Nintendo Switch and Xbox One port was released on October 31, 2020, with a PlayStation 4 port released on March 31, 2021. A planned add-on, Ultimate Custom Night, was released as a stand-alone game on June 27, 2018, while a true sequel, Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted, was released on May 28, 2019.
