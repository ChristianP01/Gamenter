Descrizione: Dwarfs!? is a 2011 real-time strategy game developed by Power of 2 and published by Tripwire Interactive. In the game, the player acts as the overseer for an underground Dwarf colony, as the player must defend them by doing things such as building walls, solidifying rock, and bombing holes as they mine for resources. The game features multiple game modes, which range from an arcade mode, where the goal is getting the highest score, to a tower defence mode. Power of 2's Robin Flodin and Teddy Sjöström conceived the game in late 2009 while studying video game design.
