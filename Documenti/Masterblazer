Anno: 1990

Descrizione: Masterblazer is a video game developed by Rainbow Arts and published by Lucasfilm Games in 1990 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS. It is the sequel to the 1985 game Ballblazer.Masterblazer presentes a futuristic sport where the playing field is a large rectangle made of squares. A Plasmorb ball must be moved into a goal as many times as possible within the course of three minutes. This is accomplished by using a Rotofoil vehicle.  Unlike its predecessor, the game features a tournament mode which allows up to 8 players to compete for the Master Blazer prize. This game also allows Rotofoils to race against each other (basically a normal game but without the ball).
