Descrizione: Bang Bang Busters is a 2010 platform video game developed by Visco Corporation and originally published by Neo Conception International for the Neo Geo AES (home). Taking place on the fictional planet of Palua in the future, where an evil being known as Honey plots to have his own galaxy, players assume the role of Lazy and Refia in order to prevent Honey and his followers from realizing their plan. Its gameplay mainly consists of platforming mixed with action elements using a main two-button configuration.
Headed by Visco founder Tetsuo Akiyama and Breakers producer Don Gabacho, Bang Bang Busters was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Visco. Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo AES, the game was later released for both Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo CD in 2011 and 2012 respectively, as well for the Dreamcast in 2018.
