Anno: 2004

Descrizione: Little Fighter Online (LFO, Chinese: 小朋友齊打交 Online) was a fighting game for Windows. It was popular at launch in Hong Kong, but has shown a rapid decline in popularity since. The gameplay itself was based on the earlier Little Fighter 2 game, which shares many of the same features. The game was produced by Marti Wong (involved in all the Little Fighter games) and Oscar Chu, a Chinese MMO developer.
In 2021, an unofficial English version was created. The version allows to replay the entire Story of the Little Fighters in English.
